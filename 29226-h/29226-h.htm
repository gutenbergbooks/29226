<h3 class="gap3"><a name="JOHN_LEACOCK" id="JOHN_LEACOCK"></a>JOHN LEACOCK</h3>


<p>Among the elusive figures of early American Drama stands
John Leacock, author of "The Fall of British Tyranny,"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> published
in 1776, in Philadelphia. Even more elusive is the identification,
inasmuch as his name has been spelled variously Leacock,
Lacock, and Laycock. To add to the confusion, Watson's
"Annals of Philadelphia," on the reminiscent word of an old
resident of that town, declares that Joseph Leacock penned
"The Medley."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> "He wrote also a play, with good humour,"
says this authority, "called 'British Tyranny.'" On careful
search of the files, no definite information in regard to Leacock
has been forthcoming. The dedication to "The Fall of British
Tyranny" was signed "Dick Rifle," but there is no information
to be traced from this pseudonym.</p>

<p>Searching the Colonial Records of Pennsylvania, I discovered
no less than three John Leacocks mentioned, all of whom were
Coroners, as well as a Joseph Leacock, who occupied the same
position. Examining the Records of the Pennsylvania Soldiers
of the Revolution, I found several John Leacocks in the ranks
as privates, and also one John Laycock.</p>

<p>Professor Moses Coit Tyler, in his "Literary History of the
American Revolution" (ii, 198), giving a list of the characters
in the play and the names of those supposed to be lampooned,
analyzes the piece thoroughly, and says, "From internal evidence,
it must be inferred that the writing of the play was finished
after the publication of 'Common Sense' in January, 1776,
and before the news had reached Philadelphia of the evacuation
of Boston, March 17, 1776." Though Sabin takes for granted
that Leacock wrote "The Fall of British Tyranny," Hildeburn,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>in the "Issues of the Press" (ii, 249), states that it is "said to have
been written by Mr. Laycock of Philadelphia." If the John
Leacock, whose name appears in the Philadelphia Directory of
1802, is the one who wrote "The Fall of British Tyranny," following
that clue we find his name disappearing from the Directory
in 1804. Hence, he must either have died, or have moved
away from Philadelphia.</p>

<p>The elusive name of Leacock is to be considered also in connection
with an opera entitled, "The Disappointment; or, The
Force of Credulity," signed by Andrew Barton,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> supposed to be
a pseudonym, and attributed variously to "Colonel" Thomas
Forrest and to John Leacock. I already have had occasion to
mention "The Disappointment" in connection with Godfrey's
"The Prince of Parthia." The reader will remember that in
1767 "The Disappointment" was put into rehearsal, but was
suddenly withdrawn in preference to Godfrey's piece. This
play has been fully and interestingly analyzed by O. G. Sonneck,
who gives the reasons for the withdrawal of the play from
rehearsal by the American Company of Philadelphia, 1767.
These reasons are definitely stated in the <i>Pennsylvania Gazette</i>
for April 16, 1767, which contains this warning in the American
Company's advertisement of "The Mourning Bride": "N.B. 'The
Disappointment' (that was advertised for Monday), as it contains
personal Reflections, is unfit for the Stage."</p>

<p>The reason why this piece is attributed to "Colonel" Thomas
Forrest is that there is a memorandum in substantiation on the
title-page of a copy owned by the Library Company of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Mr. Sonneck gives further and more extensive treatment of
the subject in his excellent book on "Early Opera in America,"
(Schirmer, 1915) as well as in "Sammelb&auml;nde der Internationale
Musik Gesellschaft," for 1914-1915.</p>

<p>We mention the matter here, because, although Sonneck enters
into a long discussion of the life of Forrest, he fails to give any
satisfactory account of John Leacock. In fact, he says in
closing, "If Andrew Barton, Esq., is to be a pseudonym, it seems
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>to me that John Leacock, claimed (by Mr. Hildeburn) to have
written the tragi-comedy of 'The Fall of British Tyranny,'
should not be cast aside so cheerfully in favour of Thomas Forrest."</p>

<p>Seilhamer and Durang, referring to the matter, mention
Joseph Leacock as a claimant for the authorship of "The Disappointment,"
and say that he was a jeweler and a silversmith
in Philadelphia; they also mention John Leacock, the Coroner.
Durang, in the "History of the Philadelphia Stage," throws all
weight in favour of Thomas Forrest. Sonneck says further,
regarding the matter,&mdash;"We may dispose of Joseph by saying
that he seems to have been among the dead when, in 1796, the
second edition of 'The Disappointment,' revised and corrected
by the author, was issued. On the other hand, Coroner John
Leacock figures in the Philadelphia Directories even later."</p>

<p>So the matter stands. The play, however, is a very definite
contribution, illustrating how quickly the American spirit
changed in the days preceding the Revolution. Imagine, in
1762, the students of the College of New Jersey giving a piece
entitled "The Military Glory of Great Britain;"<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and so short
a time afterwards, only fourteen years, in fact, a piece with the
title, "The Fall of British Tyranny," being greeted by the
theatre-going public! Leacock's attempt may be taken as the
first example that we have of an American chronicle play. And
it is likewise significant as being the first literary piece in which
George Washington appears as a character. In the advertisement,
the play is thus described (see Ford):</p>

<p>"A pleasing scene between Roger and Dick, two shepherds
near Lexington.</p>

<p>"Clarissa, etc. A very moving scene on the death of Dr. Warren,
etc., in a chamber near Boston, the morning after the battle
of Bunker's Hill.</p>

<p>"A humorous scene between the Boatswain and a Sailor on
board a man-of-war, near Norfolk in Virginia.</p>

<p>"Two very laughable scenes between the Boatswain, two
Sailors and the Cook, exhibiting specimens of seafaring oratory,
and peculiar eloquence of those sons of Neptune, touching
Tories, Convicts, and Black Regulars: and between Lord Kidnapper
and the Boatswain.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>
<p>"A very black scene between Lord Kidnapper and Major
Cudjo.</p>

<p>"A religious scene between Lord Kidnapper, Chaplain, and
the Captain.</p>

<p>"A scene, the Lord Mayor, etc., going to St. James's with the
address.</p>

<p>"A droll scene, a council of war in Boston, Admiral Tombstone,
Elbow Room, Mr. Caper, General Clinton and Earl Piercy.</p>

<p>"A diverting scene between a Whig and a Tory.</p>

<p>"A spirited scene between General Prescott and Colonel Allen.</p>

<p>"A shocking scene, a dungeon, between Colonel Allen and an
officer of the guard.</p>

<p>"Two affecting scenes in Boston after the flight of the regulars
from Lexington, between Lord Boston, messenger and
officers of the guard.</p>

<p>"A patriotic scene in the camp at Cambridge, between the
Generals Washington, Lee, and Putnam, etc., etc."</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that in the Abb&eacute; Robin's discerning
remarks, concerning the effect of drama on the pupils of Harvard
in 1781, and on the general appeal of drama among the American
Patriots, he mentions "The Fall of British Tyranny" without
giving the author's name.</p>

<h2 class="gap3"><a name="THE_DEDICATION" id="THE_DEDICATION"></a><i>THE DEDICATION</i></h2>

<div class="hangindent"><p>To Lord Boston, Lord Kidnapper, and the innumerable and
never-ending Clan of Macs and Donalds upon Donalds, and
the Remnant of the Gentlemen Officers, Actors, Merry
Andrews, strolling Players, Pirates, and Buccaneers in
America.</p></div>


<p>My Lords and Gentlemen:</p>

<p><i>Understanding you are vastly fond of plays and farces, and
frequently exhibit them for your own amusement, and the laudable
purpose of ridiculing your masters (the <span class="smcap">Yankees</span>, as you call
'em), it was expected you would have been polite enough to have
favoured the world, or America at least (at whose expense you act
them), with some of your play-bills, or with a sample of your composition.</i></p>

<p><i>I shall, however, not copy your churlishness, but dedicate the
following Tragi-Comedy to your patronage, and for your future
entertainment; and as the most of you have already acted your
particular parts of it, both comic and tragic, in reality at Lexington,
Bunker's-Hill, the Great-Bridge, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., to the very great
applause of yourselves, tho' not of the whole house, no doubt you will
preserve the marks, or memory of it, as long as you live, as it is
wrote in capital American characters and letters of blood on your
posteriors: And however some Whigs may censure you for your
affected mirth (as they term it, in the deplorable situation you are
now in, like hogs in a pen, and in want of elbow room), yet I can
by no means agree with them, but think it a proof of true heroism
and philosophy, to endeavour to make the best of a bad bargain, and
laugh at yourselves, to prevent others from laughing at you; and
tho' you are deprived of the use of your teeth, it is no reason you
should be bereaved of the use of your tongues, your eyes, your ears,
and your risible faculties and powers. That would be cruel indeed!
after the glorious and fatiguing campaign you have made, and the
many signal victories obtained over whole herds of cattle and swine,
routing flocks of sheep, lambs and geese, storming hen-roosts, and
taking them prisoners, and thereby raising the glory of Old England<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
to a pitch she never knew before. And ye Macs, and ye Donalds
upon Donalds, go on, and may our gallows-hills and liberty poles
be honour'd and adorn'd with some of your heads: Why should
Tyburn and Temple-bar make a monopoly of so valuable a commodity?</i></p>

<p><i>Wishing you abundance of entertainment in the re-acting this
Tragi-Comedy, and of which I should be proud to take a part with
you, tho' I have reason to think you would not of choice let me come
within three hundred yards of your stage, lest I should rob you of
your laurels, receive the clap of the whole house, and pass for a
second Garrick among you, as you know I always act with applause,
speak bold&mdash;point blank&mdash;off hand&mdash;and without prompter.</i></p>

<p><i>I am</i>, My Lords and Gentlemen Buffoons,</p>

<p style="margin-left:30%"><i>Your always ready humble servant,</i></p>
<p style="margin-left:60%"><span class="smcap">Dick Rifle.</span></p>

<h2 class="gap3"><a name="THE_PREFACE" id="THE_PREFACE"></a>THE PREFACE</h2>


<p>Solomon said, "Oppression makes a wise man mad:" but
what would he have said, had he lived in these days, and
seen the oppression of the people of Boston, and the distressed
situation of the inhabitants of Charlestown, Falmouth, Stonnington,
Bristol, Norfolk, &amp;c.? Would he not have said, "The
tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for
thirst; the young children ask for bread, but no man breaketh
it unto them?" "They that did feed delicately, perish in the
streets; they that were brought up in scarlet, embrace the
dung." What would he have said of rejected petitions, disregarded
supplications, and contemned remonstrances? Would
he not have said, "From hardness of heart, good Lord, deliver
us?" What would he have said of a freeborn people butchered&mdash;their
towns desolated, and become an heap of ashes&mdash;their
inhabitants become beggars, wanderers and vagabonds&mdash;by the
cruel orders of an unrelenting tyrant, wallowing in luxury, and
wantonly wasting the people's wealth, to oppress them the more?
Would he not have said, it was oppression and ingratitude in the
highest degree, exceeding the oppression of the children of Israel?
and, like Moses, have cried out, let the people go? Would he
not have wondered at our patience and long-suffering, and have
said, "'Tis time to change our master!&mdash;'Tis time to part!"&mdash;And
had he been an American born, would he not have shewed his
wisdom by adopting the language of independency? Happy
then for America in these fluctuating times, she is not without
her Solomons, who see the necessity of heark'ning to reason, and
listening to the voice of <span class="smcap">Common Sense</span>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="gap3">THE FALL</h2>

<h3>OF</h3>

<h2>BRITISH TYRANNY, &amp;c.</h2>



<h2 class="gap3"><a name="ACT_I" id="ACT_I"></a>ACT I.</h2>


<p class="center gap2"><span class="smcap">Scene</span> I. <i>At St. James's.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lord Paramount</span> [<i>solus, strutting about</i>].</p>

<p>Many long years have rolled delightfully on, whilst I have
been basking in the sunshine of grandeur and power, whilst
I have imperceptibly (tho' not unsuspected) guided the chariot
of state, and greased with the nation's gold the imperial wheels.</p>

<p>'Tis I that move the mighty engine of royalty, and with the
tincture of my somniferous opiate or (in the language of a
courtier) by the virtue of my secret influence, I have lulled the
axletree to sleep, and brought on a pleasing insensibility.</p>

<p>Let their champion, Lord Wisdom, groan, he is now become
feeble and impotent, a mere cripple in politics; their Lord Patriot's
squint has lost its basilisk effect: and the bold Irishman may
bellow the <i>Keenew</i> till he's hoarse, he's no more when compar'd
to me than an Irish salmon to a Scotch herring: I care not a
bawbee for them all. I'll reign in Britain, I'll be king of their
counsels, and chief among the princes.</p>

<p>Oh! ambition, thou darling of my soul! stop not till I rise
superior to all superlative, till I mount triumphantly the pinnacle
of glory, or at least open the way for one of my own family
and name to enter without opposition.</p>

<p>The work is now cut out, and must be finish'd, I have ventur'd
too far to recede, my honour's at stake, my importance, nay my
life, depends upon it!</p>

<p>Last night's three hours' closeting has effectually done the
business; then I spoke my mind in such terms as to make a lasting
impression, never to be eradicated&mdash;all&mdash;all was given up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
to me, and now since I hold the reins of government, since I am
possessed of supreme power, every thing shall be subservient
to my royal will and pleasure.</p>


<p class="center gap2"><span class="smcap">Scene</span> II.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Mocklaw</span>.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mocklaw.</span> I am your Lordship's most obedient humble
servant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> Be seated,&mdash;I sent for you to have a small conference
with you&mdash;and to let you know, your advice respecting
certain points of law, I have found succeeded to admiration;
even beyond my most sanguine expectations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mocklaw.</span> I am heartily glad of it, altho' the advice I gave
your Lordship, I cannot say, was law; yet, your Lordship can
easily pass it as such by a royal proclamation: and should it ever
be disputed, I have quirks and quibbles enough at your service,
with Mr. Brazen and Mr. Attorney-General's assistance, to
render it so doubtful, obscure and ambiguous, as to puzzle Lord
Justice, perplex Dunning, and confound Glynn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> Can you show me an instance of a royal proclamation
passing for a law? or advise me how to make it such, if
you can, I shall make it well worth your study.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mocklaw.</span> My Lord, as you have now got a parliament exactly
to your mind, ev'ry thing you propose will be granted; but
in order that you may see precedents are not wanting&mdash;there is
a statute in the reign of Henry the 8th that expressly shews
the then parliament passed a law that the king's proclamation
should be the law of the land&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> Are you sure of that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mocklaw.</span> My Lord, here it is&mdash;this is real law: <i>Luce meridiana
clariora</i>. When we find any thing of this kind, ready made
to our hands, it's a treasure we should never part with.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i><span class="smcap">Paramount</span> reads.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> I see it plain! this, this alone is worth a ton of
gold.&mdash;Now, by St. Andrew! I'll strike a stroke that shall surprise
all Europe, and make the boldest of the adverse party turn
pale and tremble&mdash;Scotch politics, Scotch intrigues, Scotch influence,
and Scotch impudence (as they have termed it), they
shall see ere long shine with unheard of splendour, and the name
of Lord Paramount the mighty, shall blaze in the annals of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
the world with far greater lustre (as a consummate politician)
than the name of Alexander the Great, as an hero!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mocklaw.</span> That day I much wish for,&mdash;but, with your Lordship's
permission, I would just mention, that secrecy and dissimulation
are the soul of enterprise; your Lordship hath many
enemies, who watch ev'ry movement of state with a jealous and
wary eye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> I know it, but the futile attempts of my timid
adversaries have hitherto proved abortive&mdash;so far I have borne
down all opposition, and those (even some of the greatest of
them) who not long since were my most open, as well as secret
enemies, I now behold with the most princely pleasure, the
earliest to attend, to congratulate me on my birthday, tho'
uninvited, bow down, and make the most submissive congees.
Have you not seen this, Mocklaw? and how I keep them in expectation
of something, by now and then bestowing part of a
gracious smile amongst a dozen of them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mocklaw.</span> I have, my Lord, and no doubt they interpret that
as a favourable omen;&mdash;however, policy, my Lord, would dictate
that to you, if there were no other consideration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> True, and yet they are cursedly mistaken&mdash;and
now, Mocklaw, as I have ever found you to be well dispos'd
towards me, and the cause I espouse, and as I trust you continue
satisfy'd with my former bounty, and my promise now of
granting you a pension for life, with liberty to retire, I shall
make you my confident, and disclose to you a secret no man
except myself yet knows, which I expect you have so much
honour to let it remain a secret to all the world (I mean as to
the main point I have in view).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mocklaw.</span> Depend upon it, my Lord, I am sincerely devoted
to your Lordship, command me, I care not what it is, I'll screw,
twist and strain the law as tight as a drumhead, to serve
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> I shall at this time but just give you a hint of
the plan I've drawn up in my own mind. You must have perceived
in me a secret hankering for majesty for some time past,
notwithstanding my age;&mdash;but as I have considered the great
dislike the nation in general have, as to my person, I'll wave my
own pretensions, and bend my power and assiduity to it in
favour of one, the nearest a kin to me, you know who I mean,
and a particular friend of yours, provided I continue to be dictator,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
as at present; and further, I intend America shall submit. What
think you of it so far?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mocklaw.</span> A day I've long wish'd to see! but you stagger
me, my Lord, not as to my honour, secrecy, or resolution to
serve you, but as to the accomplishment of such grand designs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> 'Tis true, I have undertaken a mighty task, a
task that would have perplexed the Council of Nice, and stagger'd
even Julius C&aelig;sar&mdash;but&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mocklaw.</span> You have need, my Lord, of all your wisdom,
fortitude and power, when you consider with whom you have
to contend&mdash;Let me see&mdash;Lord Wisdom&mdash;Lord Religion&mdash;Lord
Justice&mdash;Lord Patriot&mdash;the bold Irishman, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., and
the wisdom of the United Colonies of America in Congress to
cope with; as individuals they are trifling, but in league combined
may become potent enemies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> Granted&mdash;But are you so little of a lawyer as not
to know the virtue of a certain specific I'm possess'd of, that will
accomplish any thing, even to performing miracles? Don't you
know there's such sweet music in the shaking of the treasury keys,
that they will instantly lock the most babbling patriot's tongue?
transform a Tory into a Whig, and a Whig into a Tory? make a
superannuated old miser dance, and an old Cynic philosopher
smile. How many thousand times has your tongue danc'd at
Westminster Hall to the sound of such music?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mocklaw.</span> Enchanting sounds, powerful magic, there's no
withstanding the charms of such music, their potency and influence
are irresistible&mdash;that is a point of law I can by no means
give up, of more force than all the acts of parliament since
the days of King Alfred.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> I'm glad you acknowledge that&mdash;Now then for
a line of politics&mdash;I propose to begin first by taxing America, as a
blind&mdash;that will create an eternal animosity between us, and by
sending over continually ships and troops, this will, of course, produce
a civil war&mdash;weaken Britain by leaving her coasts defenseless,
and impoverish America; so that we need not fear any thing
from that quarter. Then the united fleets of France and Spain
with troops to appear in the channel, and make a descent, while
my kinsman with thirty thousand men lands in Scotland, marches
to London, and joins the others: What then can prevent the
scheme from having the wish'd for effect? This is the main
point, which keep to yourself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mocklaw.</span> If it has failed heretofore, 'tis impossible it should
fail now; nothing within the reach of human wisdom was ever
planned so judiciously; had Solomon been alive, and a politician, I
would have sworn your Lordship had consulted him.&mdash;But I would
beg leave to hint to your Lordship the opposition to be apprehended
from the militia of England, and the German forces that
may be sent for according to treaty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> As to the militia, they are half of them my
friends, witness Lancaster, Manchester, Liverpool, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.,
the other half scarce ever fired a gun in their lives, especially
those of London; and I shall take care by shaking the keys a
little to have such officers appointed over them, who are well
known to be in my interest. As to the German forces, I have
nothing to apprehend from them; the parliament can soon
pass an act against the introduction of foreign troops, except
the French or Spaniards, who can't be called foreign, they are
our friends and nearest neighbours. Have you any thing
further to object against the probability of this plan?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mocklaw.</span> Nothing, my Lord, but the people of Ireland, who
must be cajoled or humbugg'd.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> As to that, let me alone, I shall grant the Roman
Catholics, who are by far the most numerous, the free exercise
of their religion, with the liberty of bearing arms, so long unjustly
deprived of, and disarm in due time all the Protestants in
their turn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mocklaw.</span> That will be a noble stroke, the more I consider
it, the more I'm surpris'd at your Lordship's profound wisdom
and foresight: I think success is certain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> Then this is the favourable crisis to attempt it;
'tis not the thought of a day, a month, or a year. Have you
any more objections?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mocklaw.</span> I have one more, my Lord&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> Well, pray let's hear it; these lawyers will be
heard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mocklaw.</span> The Bishops and Clergy are a powerful, numerous
body; it would be necessary, my Lord, to gain them over, or
keep them silent&mdash;A religious war is the worst of wars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> You are very right, I have 'em fast enough&mdash;Mammon
will work powerfully on them&mdash;The keys&mdash;the keys&mdash;His
Grace my Lord of Suffolk is managing this business for me,
and feeding them with the hopes of being all created Archbishops<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
here, and each to have a diocese, and Bishops of their own
appointment in America; not a city or town there but must be
provided with a Bishop: There let religion erect her holy altars,
by which means their revenues will be augmented beyond that
of a Cardinal. All this we must make 'em believe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mocklaw.</span> True, my Lord, what is a Bishop without faith?
This is the grandest stroke of religious circumvention that ever
was struck.&mdash;I've done, my Lord.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> Very well, you'll not fail to meet the privy council
here this evening; in the mean time you'll go and search the
statutes for other precedents to strengthen the cause; and remember
I have enjoin'd you to secrecy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mocklaw.</span> Depend upon it, my Lord, I cannot prove ungrateful
to your Lordship, nor such an enemy to myself.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Mocklaw</span>.</i></p>


<p class="center gap2"><span class="smcap">Scene</span> III. <span class="smcap">Lord Paramount</span> [<i>solus</i>].</p>

<p>This Mocklaw is a cursed knowing dog, and I believe the father
of Brazen; how readily he found an old act of parliament to my
purpose, as soon as I told him I would make it worth his study;
and the thoughts of a pension will make him search his old
worm-eaten statute books from the reign of King Arthur down
to this present time; how he raises objections too to make me
think his mind is ever bent on study to serve me. The shaking
of the treasury keys is a fine bait. [<i>Rings the bell.</i>] Charters,
magna chartas, bill of rights, acts of assembly, resolves of congresses,
trials by juries (and acts of parliament too) when they
make against us, must all be annihilated; a suspending power I
approve of, and of royal proclamations.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Charley</span>.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley.</span> I wait your Lordship's orders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> Write a number of cards, and see that the Lords
of the privy council, and Mr. Judas, be summoned to give their
attendance this evening at six o'clock, at my Pandemonium.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley.</span> I'm gone, my Lord.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Charley</span>.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Paramount</span> [<i>solus</i>].</p>

<p>How do we shew our authority? how do we maintain the
royal prerogative? keep in awe the knowing ones of the opposite
party, and blind the eyes of the ignorant multitude in Britain?
Why, by spirited measures, by an accumulation of power, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
deception, and the shaking of the keys, we may hope to succeed,
should that fail, I'll enforce them with the pointed bayonet; the
Americans from one end to the other shall submit, in spite of
all opposition; I'll listen to no overtures of reconciliation from
any petty self-constituted congress, they shall submit implicitly
to such terms as I of my royal indulgence please to grant. I'll
shew them the impudence and weakness of their resolves, and
the strength of mine; I will never soften; my inflexibility shall
stand firm, and convince them the second Pharaoh is at least
equal to the first. I am unalterably determined at every hazard
and at the risk of every consequence to compel the colonies to
absolute submission. I'll draw in treasure from every quarter,
and, Solomon-like, wallow in riches; and Scotland, my dear
Scotland, shall be the paradise of the world. Rejoice in the
name of Paramount, and the sound of a bawbee shall be no
more heard in the land of my nativity.&mdash;</p>


<p class="center gap2"><span class="smcap">Scene</span> IV.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Charley</span> in haste.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley.</span> My Lord, the notices are all served.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> It's very well, Charley.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley.</span> My Lord, be pleased to turn your eyes, and look
out of the window, and see the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, Common
Council and Liverymen going to St. James's with the address.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> Where? Sure enough&mdash;Curse their impudence;
how that squinting scoundrel swells with importance&mdash;Mind,
Charley, how fond he is of bowing to the gaping multitude, and
ev'ry upstart he sees at a window&mdash;I hope he'll not turn his
blear eyes t'wards me&mdash;I want none of his bows, not I&mdash;Stand
before me, Charley&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley.</span> I will, my Lord, and if he looks this way, I'll give
him such a devilish grin as best suits such fellows as him, and
make him remember it as long as he lives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> Do so, Charley; I hate the dog mortally, I religiously
hate him, and hope ere long to have satisfaction for his
insolence and the freedoms he has taken with me and my connections:
I shall never forget the many scandalous verses,
lampoons and pasquinades he made upon us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley.</span> Indeed, he has used your Lordship too ill ever to
be forgotten or forgiven.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> Damn him, I never intend to do either&mdash;See
again how he bows&mdash;there again&mdash;how the mob throw up their
hats, split their throats; how they huzza too; they make a mere
god of the fellow; how they idolize him&mdash;Ignorant brutes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley.</span> A scoundrel; he has climb'd up the stilts of preferment
strangely, my Lord.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> Strangely, indeed; but it's our own faults.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley.</span> He has had better luck than honester folks; I'm
surpris'd to think he has ever rose to the honour of presenting a
remonstrance, or rather, that he could ever have the impudence
to think of remonstrating.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> Aye, Charley, you see how unaccountably things
turn out; his audacity is unparalleled&mdash;a Newgate dog.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley.</span> My Lord, I believe the fellow was never known to
blush; and, indeed, it's an observation I made some time ago,
and I believe a just one, without an exception, that those who
squint never blush.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> You must be mistaken, Charley.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley.</span> No, my Lord, it's a fact, I had an uncle squinted
exactly like him, who was guilty of many scandalous things, and
yet all the parish, with the parson at their head, could not make
him blush, so that at last he became a by-word&mdash;Here comes
old shame-the-devil; this dog is the very spawn of him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> Hoot, mon, ye give your uncle a shocking character.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley.</span> I only mention it, my Lord, for the similarity's
sake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> For the spawn of him, and the similarity's sake,
I'm apt to think you've been abusing your own cousin all this
while.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley.</span> God forbid, my Lord, I should be any how allied
to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> I fancy, Charley, if the truth was known, your
uncle did not mention you in his will, and forgot to leave you
the mansion-house and farm at Gallows-hill. Am I right,
Charley?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley.</span> You're right, my Lord, upon my honour&mdash;but&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> I thought so&mdash;Well, never mind&mdash;Ha, ha, ha,
who are those two fat fellows there, that go in such state?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley.</span> I suppose them to be a couple of Livery Tallow-chandlers,
my Lord, by their big bellies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> Ha, ha,&mdash;what work the guards would make
amongst them&mdash;but they must not be called yet.&mdash;And who are
those other two behind 'em?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley.</span> This is Mr. Hone, and the other Mr. Strap, a
couple of the Corporation Barbers, forsooth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> Ha, ha, ha, I thought they had been a couple
of Dukes;&mdash;and that one&mdash;who is he with the monstrous wig?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley.</span> That is Mr. Alderman Pipeshank, in Newgate-street.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> A parcel of Newgate dogs altogether&mdash;Well it
is a good deal of satisfaction to me to think how this fellow will
be received at St. James's; he'll not return back so pleas'd as
he seems to be now, I warrant you&mdash;I have taken care he shall
meet with a d&mdash;&mdash;d cold reception there; he will have to make
his appearance before Lord Frostyface, Lord Scarecrow, Lord
Sneerwell, Lord Firebrand, Lord Mawmouth, Lord Waggonjaws,
Lord Gripe, Lord Brass, Lord Surly and Lord Tribulation,
as hard-fac'd fellows as himself; and the beauty of it is,
not one of them loves him a whit more than I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley.</span> That will be rare diversion for them that are
present; he'll look then, my Lord, like Sampson making sport
for the Philistines.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> Aye, but I wish he was as blind too, as Sampson
was.&mdash;Well Charley, we have been dispos'd to be a little merry
with this ridiculous parade, this high life below stairs. I wish
you had begun your description a little sooner, before they were
all gone; the looks of these wiseacres afford us some mirth, tho'
we despise them and their politics, and it's not unlikely it may
end in blood&mdash;Be it so, I'm prepar'd for the worst.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley.</span> Rather so, my Lord, than submit to such rascals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> I'll give up my life first for a sacrifice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> My Lords and Gentlemen, it seems opposition
to our measures are making hasty strides; the discontented
faction, the supporters and encouragers of rebellion, and whole
hearts are tainted therewith, seem bent, if possible, on the
destruction of Britain, and their own aggrandisement. Are not
the daily papers filled with treasonable resolves of American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
congresses and committees, extracts of letters, and other
infamous pieces and scurrilous pamphlets, circulating with
unusual industry throughout the kingdom, by the enemies of
Britain, thereby poisoning the minds of our liege subjects with
their detestable tenets?&mdash;And did you not this day see the
procession, and that vile miscreant Lord Patriot at their head,
going to St. James's with their remonstrance, in such state and
parade as manifestly tended to provoke, challenge and defy
majesty itself, and the powers of government? and yet nothing
done to stop their pernicious effects.&mdash;Surely, my Lords and
Gentlemen, you must agree with me, that it is now become
highly expedient that an immediate stop should be put to such
unwarrantable and dangerous proceedings, by the most vigorous
and coercive measures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mocklaw.</span> I entirely agree with your Lordship, and was ever
firmly of opinion, that licentiousness of every kind (particularly
that of the Press) is dangerous to the state; the rabble should be
kept in awe by examples of severity, and a proper respect should
be enforced to superiors. I have sufficiently shewn my dislike to
the freedom of the Press, by the examples I have frequently
made (tho' too favourable) of several Printers, and others, who
had greatly trespassed, and if they still persist, other measures
should be taken with them, which the laws will point out; and
as to Lord Patriot, he's a fellow that has been outlaw'd, scandal-proof,
little to be got by meddling with him; I would advise to
let him alone for the present, and humble America first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Brazen.</span> I am very clear in it, please your Lordship;
there are numbers of men in this country who are ever studying
how to perplex and entangle the state, constantly thwarting
government, in ev'ry laudable undertaking; this clamorous
faction must be curbed, must be subdued and crush'd&mdash;our
thunder must go forth, America must be conquered. I am for
blood and fire to crush the rising glories of America&mdash;They boast
of her strength; she must be conquered, if half of Germany is
called to our assistance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Poltron.</span> I entirely agree with you, Mr. Brazen; my
advice is, that Lord Boston and Admiral Tombstone be immediately
despatch'd to Boston, with two or three regiments (tho'
one would be more than sufficient) and a few ships to shut up
their ports, disannul their charter, stop their trade, and the
pusillanimous beggars, those scoundrel rascals, whose predomi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>nant
passion is fear, would immediately give up, on the first
landing of the regulars, and fly before 'em like a hare before
the hounds; that this would be the case, I pawn my honour to
your Lordships, nay, I'll sacrifice my life: My Lords, I have
moreover the testimony of General Amherst and Colonel Grant
to back my assertion; besides, here's Mr. Judas, let him speak.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Hypocrite.</span> If this is the same Colonel Grant that was
at Fort Duquesne, the same that ran away from the French and
Indians, the same that was rescued by Colonel Washington, I
have no idea of his honour or testimony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Poltron.</span> He's a Gentleman, my Lord Hypocrite, of
undoubted veracity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Hypocrite.</span> You might as well have said courage too,
I have exceptions against both; and as to General Amherst's
assertion that he could drive all America with five thousand
men, he must have been joking, as he is quite of a diff'rent
opinion now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Catspaw.</span> What is your opinion of your countrymen,
Mr. Judas, with respect to their courage?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judas.</span> The same that I have ever told you, my Lord; as
to true courage they have none, I know 'em well&mdash;they have a
plenty of a kind of enthusiastic zeal, which they substitute in
the room of it; I am very certain they would never face the
regulars, tho' with the advantage of ten to one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Hypocrite.</span> All this, and a great deal more, would
never convince me of the general cowardice of the Americans&mdash;but
of the cowardice of Grant I've been long convinced, by
numbers of letters formerly from America&mdash;I'm for doing the
business effectually; don't let us be too sanguine, trust to stories
told by every sycophant, and hurry heels over head to be laugh'd
at; the Americans are bold, stubborn, and sour; it will require
foreign assistance to subdue 'em.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Catspaw.</span> These four Americans, ignorant brutes, unbroke
and wild, must be tamed; they'll soon be humble if
punish'd; but if disregarded, grow fierce.&mdash;Barbarous nations
must be held by fear, rein'd and spurr'd hard, chain'd to the
oar, and bow'd to due control, till they look grim with blood;
let's first humble America, and bring them under our feet; the
olive-branch has been held out, and they have rejected it; it now
becomes us to use the iron rod to break their disobedience; and
should we lack it, foreign assistance is at hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Hypocrite.</span> All this I grant, but I'm for sending a force
sufficient to crush 'em at once, and not with too much precipitation;
I am first for giving it a colour of impartiality, forbearance
and religion.&mdash;Lay it before parliament; we have then law on our
side, and endeavour to gain over some or all of the Methodist
Teachers, and in particular my very good friend Mr. Wesley, their
Bishop, and the worthy Mr. Clapum, which task I would undertake;
it will then have the sanction of religion, make it less suspected,
and give it a better grace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Catspaw.</span> I should choose it to be done by consent of
parliament; we stand then on firmer ground; there's no doubt
they'll grant ev'ry thing your Lordship proposes upon my motion:
but to tell the truth, I'd rather be in Purgatory so long, than
to run the gauntlet of the Bold Irishman's tongue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mocklaw.</span> Aye, aye, don't part with the law while it's in our
favour, or we can have it by asking for&mdash;and as to the Bold Irishman,
don't be brow-beaten, you must summon all your brass,
and put on a rugged highwayman's face like his; I expect some
work of that kind too, but the devil himself sha'n't browbeat me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramount.</span> I am glad to find, my Lords and Gentlemen, you
all see the necessity of sending over troops and ships; I intend my
Lord Catspaw shall lay it before parliament, and am very certain
they'll pass any acts I can desire. I thank you, Lord Hypocrite,
for your kind offer, and accept of it; my Lord of Suffolk is negotiating
the same business with the rest of my Lords the Bishops,
and will succeed; so that it will carry the appearance of law, of
religion, and will be sufficiently grac'd; I'll warrant you no one
shall have cause to complain of its wanting grace. And now,
my Lords and Gentlemen, as it's so late, and we have gone
through all the business at this time proposed, you are at your
liberty to withdraw.</p>

<p class="center gap2"><span class="smcap">Scene</span> I.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lord Wisdom</span>, <span class="smcap">Lord Religion</span>, <span class="smcap">Lord Justice</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lord Wisdom.</span></p>

<p>I much lament, my Lords, the present unhappy situation of
my country; where e'er I turn mine eyes, to Europe, Asia, Africa,
or America, the prospect appears the same&mdash;Look up to the
throne, and behold your king, if I may now call him by that soft
title&mdash;Where is the wisdom, the justice, the religion, that once
adorn'd that throne, and shed the benign influence of their bright
rays thro' the four quarters of the globe? Alas! they're flown!</p>

<p>Mark his forlorn looks&mdash;his countenance dejected, a sullen
greatness fixed on his brow, as if it veil'd in blood some awful
purpose, his eyes flaming and sanguinary; how I bewail you,
for your predecessor's sake! Long, long have I been an old,
and I trust a faithful, servant in the family&mdash;Can I then restrain
one tear? No, 'tis impossible! View that arch-dragon, that old
fiend, Paramount, that rebel in grain, whispering in his ear.
View his wretched ministers hovering round him, to accomplish
their accursed purpose, and accelerate his destruction. View the
whole herd of administration (I know 'em well) and tell me if
the world can furnish a viler set of miscreants? View both houses
of parliament, and count the number of Tyrants, Jacobites,
Tories, Placemen, Pensioners, Sycophants, and Panders. View
the constitution, is she not disrob'd and dismantled? is she not
become like a virgin deflower'd? View our fleets and armies
commanded by bloody, murdering butchers! View Britain herself
as a sheep without a shepherd! And lastly view America,
for her virtue bleeding and for her liberty weltering in her blood!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Religion.</span> Such hath, and ever will be the fate of
kings, who only listen to the voice of pleasure, thrown in their
way by the sirens of administration, which never fail to swallow
them up like quicksand&mdash;like a serpent, who charms and fascinates,
bewitches and enchants with his eye the unwary bird;
witness the fatal catastrophe of Rehoboam, who rejected the
counsel of the wise and experienced, and gave up all to the
advice and guidance of young, unskilful and wicked counsellors.
Had he listen'd to you, my Lord, had he followed your advice,
all, all would have gone well&mdash;Under your auspicious adminis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>tration
Britain flourished, but ever since has been on the decline
and patriotism, like religion, scarcely now more than a sounding
brass or a tinkling cymbal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Wisdom.</span> My counsel has been rejected&mdash;my conciliatory
plan thrown under the table, and treated with contempt;
the experience of gray hairs called the superannuated notions
of old age&mdash;my bodily infirmities&mdash;my tottering frame&mdash;my
crazy carcase, worn out in the service of my country, and even
my very crutches, have been made the subject of their ridicule.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Justice.</span> Gratitude, like religion and patriotism, are
about taking their flight, and the law of the land stands on tip-toe;
the constitution, that admirable fabric, that work of ages,
the envy of the world, is deflower'd indeed, and made to commit
a rape upon her own body, by the avaricious frowns of her own
father, who is bound to protect her, not to destroy.&mdash;Her pillars
are thrown down, her capitals broke, her pedestals demolish'd,
and her foundation nearly destroy'd.&mdash;Lord Paramount and his
wretched adviser Mocklaw baffle all our efforts.&mdash;The statutes
of the land superseded by royal proclamations and dispensing
powers, &amp;c., &amp;c., the bloody knife to be held to the throats of
the Americans, and force them to submit to slav'ry.&mdash;Administration
have commenced bloody tyrants, and those that should
protect the subject are become their executioners; yet will I
dispute with them inch by inch, while there's a statute book left
in the land. Come forth, thou grand deceiver! I challenge thee
to come forth!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Wisdom.</span> Our friends must bestir themselves once more,
perhaps we may yet turn the scale.&mdash;If the voice of religion,
wisdom and justice should fail, let us sound the trumpet of
liberty and patriotism, that will conquer them in America, I
know; let us try to storm them here with the united whole, and
if by a base majority they still carry their point, we can nevertheless
wash our hands and be clean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Religion.</span> From the pulpit, in the house of God, have
I spoken aloud, I have lifted up my voice like a trumpet. O
Britain, how art thou fallen! Hear now, O house of Britain, is
it a small thing for you to weary man, but will you weary your
God also? In the house of Lords have I borne my testimony:
Hear now, O ye Princes, and I will yet declare in Britain,
and shew forth in America, I will not cease till I bring about
(if possible) unity, peace and concord.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Wisdom.</span> Much to be wished for; but alas! I fear it's
now too late; I foresee the tendency and consequence of those
diabolical measures that have been pursued with unrelenting fury.
Britain will ruin her trade, waste her wealth, her strength, her
credit and her importance in the scale of Europe. When a British
king proves ungrateful and haughty, and strives to be independent
of his people (who are his sole support), the people will in their
turn likewise strive to be independent of him and his myrmidons,
and will be free; they will erect the anfractuous standard of independency,
and thousands and tens of thousands will flock to it,
and solace themselves under its shade.&mdash;They has often been told
of this, but affected to despise it; they know not America's
strength, they are ignorant of it; fed by the flatt'ry of every
sycophant tale, imagine themselves almighty, and able to subdue
the whole world. America will be lost to Britain forever, and
will prove her downfall. America is wise, and will shake off the
galling yoke before it be rivetted on them; they will be drove to
it, and who can blame them? Who can blame a galley-slave for
making his escape?&mdash;Britain will miscarry in her vile projects,
her knight errant, her Don Quixote schemes in America: America
will resist; they are not easily to be subdued (nay, 'tis impossible);
Britain will find it a harder task than to conquer France and
Spain united, and will cost 'em more blood and treasure than a
twice Seven Years' War with those European powers; they will
stand out till Britons are tired. Britain will invite her with kind
promises and open arms; America will reject them; America will
triumph, rejoice and flourish, and become the glory of the earth;
Britain will languidly hold down her head, and become first a
prey to a vile Pretender, and then be subject to the ravagers of
Europe. I love the Americans, because they love liberty. Liberty
flourishes in the wilds of America. I honour the plant, I
revere the tree, and would cherish its branches. Let us, my
friends, join hands with them, follow their example, and endeavour
to support expiring liberty in Britain; whilst I have a
tongue to speak, I will support her wherever found; while I have
crutches to crawl with, I will try to find her out, and with the
voice of an archangel will demand for a sacrifice to the nation
those miscreants who have wickedly and wantonly been the ruin
of their country. O Liberty! O my Country!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Religion.</span> O Religion! O Virtue! whither art thou
fleeing? O thou Defender of the Faith? O ye mighty Lords<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
and Commons! O ye deluded Bishops, ye learned props of our
unerring church, who preach up vengeance, force and fire, instead
of peace! be wise in time, lest the Americans be driven to work
out their own salvation without fear or trembling.</p>

<p class="center gap2"><span class="smcap">Scene</span> II.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lord Patriot</span>, <span class="smcap">Bold Irishman</span>, <span class="smcap">Colonel</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Bold Irishman.</span></p>

<p>That Brazen Lawyer,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> that Lord Chancellor, that wou'd be,
held forth surprisingly last night, he beat the drum in your ears,
brother soldier.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel.</span> I think he did; he beat a Tatoo for us all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Patriot.</span> No politicians, but lawyer politicians, it seems
will go down; if we believe him, we must all turn lawyers now,
and prate away the liberties of the nation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel.</span> Aye, first we must learn to rail at the clamourous
faction, disappointed politicians&mdash;ever restless&mdash;ever plotting&mdash;constantly
thwarting government, in laudable and blameable
purposes.&mdash;Inconsiderable party&mdash;inconsistent in their own politics&mdash;hostile
to all government, soured by disappointment, and
urged by want&mdash;proceeding to unjustifiable lengths&mdash;and then
sound the magnanimity of a British senate, animated by the
sacred fire caught from a high-spirited people&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bold Irishman.</span> And the devil knows what beside&mdash;Magnanimity
and sacred fire, indeed!&mdash;Very magnanimous sounds, but
pompous nothings! Why did he not tell us where was the
magnanimity of the British senate at the time of the dispute
about Falkland's Island? What sort of fire animated them
then?&mdash;Where was the high spirit of the people?&mdash;Strange sort
of fire, and strange sort of spirit, to give up to our inveterate
enemies, the Spaniards, our property unasked for, and cut our
best friends and brethren, the Americans' throats, for defending
theirs against lawless tyranny; their sacred fire became then
all fume, and the strength of their boasted spirits evaporated
into invisible effluvium; the giant then sunk sure enough spontaneously
into a dwarf; and now, it seems, the dwarf having been
feeding upon smoky fire and evaporated spirits, is endeavouring
to swell himself into a giant again, like the frog in the fable,
till he bursts himself in silent thunder&mdash;But let the mighty
Philistine, the Goliath Paramount, and his oracle Mocklaw,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
with their thunder bellowed from the brazen mortar-piece of a
turn-coat lawyer, have a care of the little American David!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Patriot.</span> Aye, indeed! America will prove a second
Sampson to 'em; they may put out his eyes for a while, but
he'll pull their house down about their ears for all that. Mr.
Brazen seem'd surpris'd at the thought of relinquishing America,
and bawl'd out with the vociferation of an old miser that had
been robb'd&mdash;Relinquish America! relinquish America! forbid
it heavens! But let him and his masters take great care, or
America will save 'em the trouble, and relinquish Britain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel.</span> Or I'm much mistaken, Brazen says, establish
first your superiority, and then talk of negotiating.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Patriot.</span> That doctrine suits 'em best; just like a
cowardly pickpocket, or a bloody highwayman, knock a man
down first, and then tell him stand and deliver.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel.</span> A just comparison, and excellent simile, by my
soul! But I'm surpris'd he did not include the Clergy among
the number of professions unfit (as he said) to be politicians.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bold Irishman.</span> Did you ever know a lawyer to be concerned
with religion, unless he got a fee by it? he'll take care and steer
clear of that; if it don't come in his way, he'll never break his
neck over a church bible, I warrant you&mdash;Mammon is his god&mdash;Judge
Jeffereys is his priest&mdash;Star-chamber doctrine is his
creed&mdash;fire, flames and faggot, blood, murder, halters and
thund'ring cannon are the ceremonies of his church&mdash;and lies,
misrepresentations, deceit, hypocrisy and dissimulation are the
articles of his religion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Patriot.</span> You make him a monster, indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bold Irishman.</span> Not half so bad as he is, my Lord; he's following
close to the heels of that profound sage, that oracle,
Mocklaw, his tutor: I can compare the whole herd of them to
nothing else but to the swine we read of running headlong down
the hill, Paramount their devil, Mocklaw the evil spirit, and
Brazen their driver.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel.</span> And thus they'll drive liberty from out the land; but
when a brave people, like the Americans, from their infancy us'd
to liberty (not as a gift, but who inherit it as a birth-right, but not
as a mess of pottage, to be bought by, or sold to, ev'ry hungry
glutton of a minister) find attempts made to reduce them to
slavery, they generally take some desperate successful measure
for their deliverance. I should not be at all surpris'd to hear of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
independency proclaim'd throughout their land, of Britain's
armies beat, their fleets burnt, sunk, or otherwise destroy'd.
The same principle which Mr. Brazen speaks of, that inspires
British soldiers to fight, namely the ferment of youthful blood, the
high spirit of the people, a love of glory, and a sense of national
honour, will inspire the Americans to withstand them; to which
I may add, liberty and property.&mdash;But what is national honour?
Why, national pride.&mdash;What is national glory? Why, national
nonsense, when put in competition with liberty and property.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Patriot.</span> Of Britain I fear liberty has taken its farewell,
the aspiring wings of tyranny hath long hovered over, and
the over-shadowing influence of bribery hath eclips'd its rays
and dark'ned its lustre; the huge Paramount, that temporal
deity, that golden calf, finds servile wretches enough so base as
to bow down, worship and adore his gilded horns;&mdash;let 'em e'en
if they will:&mdash;But as for me, tho' I should stand alone, I would
spurn the brute, were he forty-five<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> times greater than he is;
I'll administer, ere long, such an emetic to him, as shall make
the monster disgorge the forty millions yet unaccounted for,
and never shall it be said, that Patriot ever feared or truckled
to him, or kept a silent tongue when it should speak.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bold Irishman.</span> There I'll shake hands with you, and my
tongue shall echo in their ears, make their arched ceiling speak,
the treasury bench crack, and the great chair of their great
speaker tremble, and never will I cease lashing them, while lashing
is good, or hope remains; and when the voice of poor liberty
can no longer be heard in Britain or Hibernia, let's give Caledonia
a kick with our heels, and away with the goddess to the
American shore, crown her, and defy the grim king of tyranny,
at his peril, to set his foot there.&mdash;Here let him stay, and wallow
in sackcloth and ashes, like a beast as he is, and, Nebuchadnezzar-like,
eat grass and thistles.</p>

<h2 class="gap3"><a name="ACT_III" id="ACT_III"></a>ACT III.</h2>


<p class="center gap2"><span class="smcap">Scene</span> I. <i>In Boston.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Selectman</span>, <span class="smcap">Citizen</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Selectman.</span></p>

<p>At length, it seems, the bloody flag is hung out, the ministry
and parliament, ever studious in mischief, and bent on our
destruction, have ordered troops and ships of war to shut our
ports, and starve us into submission.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Citizen.</span> And compel us to be slaves; I have heard so. It is
a fashionable way to requite us for our loyalty, for the present
we made them of Louisburg, for our protection at Duquesne,
for the assistance we gave them at Quebec, Martinico, Guadaloupe
and the Havannah. Blast their councils, spurn their ingratitude!
Soul of Pepperel! whither art thou fled?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selectman.</span> They seem to be guided by some secret demon;
this stopping our ports and depriving us of all trade is cruel,
calculated to starve and beggar thousands of families, more
spiteful than politic, more to their own disadvantage than
ours: But we can resolve to do without trade; it will be the
means of banishing luxury, which has ting'd the simplicity and
spotless innocence of our once happy asylum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Citizen.</span> We thank heaven, we have the necessaries of life
in abundance, even to an exuberant plenty; and how oft have
our hospitable tables fed numbers of those ungrateful monsters,
who would now, if they could, famish us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selectman.</span> No doubt, as we abound in those temporal
blessings, it has tempted them to pick our pockets by violence,
in hopes of treasures more to their minds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Citizen.</span> In that these thirsters after gold and human blood
will be disappointed. No Perus or Mexicos here they'll find;
but the demon you speak of, tho' he acts in secret, is notoriously
known. Lord Paramount is that demon, that bird of prey, that
ministerial cormorant, that waits to devour, and who first
thought to disturb the repose of America; a wretch, no friend
to mankind, who acts thro' envy and avarice, like Satan, who
'scap'd from hell to disturb the regions of paradise; after ransacking
Britain and Hibernia for gold, the growth of hell, to
feed his luxury, now waits to rifle the bowels of America.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selectman.</span> May he prove more unsuccessful than Satan;
blind politics, rank infatuation, madness detestable, the con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>comitants
of arbitrary power! They can never think to succeed;
but should they conquer, they'll find that he who overcometh by
force and blood, hath overcome but half his foe. Capt. Preston's
massacre is too recent in our memories; and if a few troops dar'd
to commit such hellish unprovok'd barbarities, what may we
not expect from legions arm'd with vengeance, whose leaders
harbour principles repugnant to freedom, and possess'd with
more than diabolical notions? Surely our friends will oppose
them with all the power heaven has given them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Citizen.</span> Nothing more certain; each citizen and each individual
inhabitant of America are bound by the ties of nature;
the laws of God and man justify such a procedure; passive
obedience for passive slaves, and non-resistance for servile
wretches who know not, neither deserve, the sweets of liberty.
As for me and my house, thank God, such detestable doctrine
never did, nor ever shall, enter over my threshold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selectman.</span> Would all America were so zealous as you.&mdash;The
appointment of a general Continental Congress was a
judicious measure, and will prove the salvation of this new
world, where counsel mature, wisdom and strength united; it
will prove a barrier, a bulwark, against the encroachments of
arbitrary power.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Citizen.</span> I much approve of the choice of a congress; America
is young, she will be to it like a tender nursing mother, she will
give it the paps of virtue to suck, cherish it with the milk of
liberty, and fatten it on the cream of patriotism; she will train
it up in its youth, and teach it to shun the poison of British
voluptuousness, and instruct it to keep better company. Let
us, my friend, support her all in our power, and set on foot an
immediate association; they will form an intrenchment, too
strong for ministerial tyranny to o'erleap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selectman.</span> I am determined so to do, it may prevent the
farther effusion of blood.</p>


<p class="center gap2"><span class="smcap">Scene</span> II.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter a <span class="smcap">Minister</span>.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Minister.</span></p>

<p>My friends, I yet will hail you good morrow, tho' I know not
how long we may be indulg'd that liberty to each other; doleful
tidings I have to tell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selectman.</span> With sorrow we have heard it, good morrow, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minister.</span> Wou'd to God it may prove false, and that it
may vanish like the dew of the morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Citizen.</span> Beyond a doubt, sir, it's too true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minister.</span> Perhaps, my friends, you have not heard all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selectman.</span> We have heard too much, of the troops and
ships coming over, we suppose you mean; we have not heard
more, if more there be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minister.</span> Then worse I have to tell, tidings which will raise
the blood of the patriot, and put your virtue to the proof, will
kindle such an ardent love of liberty in your breasts, as time
will not be able to exterminate&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Citizen.</span> Pray, let us hear it, I'm all on fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selectman.</span> I'm impatient to know it, welcome or unwelcome.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minister.</span> Such as it is, take it; your charter is annihilated;
you are all, all declared rebels; your estates are to be confiscated;
your patrimony to be given to those who never labour'd for it;
popery to be established in the room of the true catholic faith;
the Old South, and other houses of our God, converted perhaps
into nunneries, inquisitions, barracks and common jails, where
you will perish with want and famine, or suffer an ignominious
death; your wives, children, dearest relations and friends forever
separated from you in this world, without the prospect of receiving
any comfort or consolation from them, or the least hope of
affording any to them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selectman.</span> Perish the thought!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Citizen.</span> I've heard enough!&mdash;To arms! my dear friends, to
arms! and death or freedom be our motto!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minister.</span> A noble resolution! Posterity will crown the urn
of the patriot who consecrates his talents to virtue and freedom;
his name shall not be forgot; his reputation shall bloom with
unfading verdure, while the name of the tyrant, like his vile
body, shall moulder in the dust. Put your trust in the Lord of
hosts, he is your strong tower, he is your helper and defense, he
will guide and strengthen the arm of flesh, and scatter your enemies
like chaff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selectman.</span> Let us not hesitate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Citizen.</span> Not a single moment;&mdash;'tis like to prove a mortal
strife, a never-ending contest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minister.</span> Delays may be dangerous.&mdash;Go and awake your
brethren that sleep;&mdash;rouse them up from their lethargy and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
supineness, and join, with confidence, temporal with spiritual
weapons. Perhaps they be now landing, and this moment, this
very moment, may be the last of your liberty. Prepare yourselves&mdash;be
ready&mdash;stand fast&mdash;ye know not the day nor the
hour. May the Ruler of all send us liberty and life. Adieu!
my friends.</p>

<p class="center gap2"><span class="smcap">Scene</span> III. <i>In a street in Boston.</i></p>

<p class="hangindent"><i>Frequent town-meetings and consultations amongst the inhabitants;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord
Boston</span> arrives with the forces and ships;&mdash;lands and
fortifies Boston.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i><span class="smcap">Whig</span> and <span class="smcap">Tory</span>.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whig.</span> I have said and done all that man could say or do.&mdash;'Tis
wrong, I insist upon it, and time will show it, to suffer them
to take possession of Castle William and fortify Boston Neck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tory.</span> I cannot see, good sir, of what advantage it will be to
them;&mdash;they've only a mind, I suppose, to keep their soldiers
from being inactive, which may prejudice their health.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whig.</span> I wish it may prove so, I would very gladly confess
your superior knowledge in military man&oelig;uvres; but till then,
suffer me to tell you, it's a stroke the most fatal to us,&mdash;no less,
sir, but to cut off the communication between the town and
country, making prisoners of us all by degrees, and give 'em an
opportunity of making excursions, and in a short time subdue
us without resistance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tory.</span> I think your fears are groundless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whig.</span> Sir, my reason is not to be trifled with. Do you not
see or hear ev'ry day of insults and provocations to the peaceable
inhabitants? This is only a prelude. Can men of spirit bear
forever with such usage? I know not what business they have
here at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tory.</span> I suppose they're come to protect us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whig.</span> Damn such protectors, such cut-throat villains; protect
us? from what? from whom?&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tory.</span> Nay, sir, I know not their business;&mdash;let us yet bear
with them till we know the success of the petition from the
Congress;&mdash;if unfavourable, then it will be our time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whig.</span> Then, I fear, it will be too late; all that time we lose,
and they gain ground; I have no notion of trusting to the success
of petitions, waiting twelve months for no answer at all. Our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
assemblies have petitioned often, and as often in vain; 't would be
a miracle in these days to hear of an American petition being
granted; their omnipotences, their demi-godships (as they think
themselves) no doubt think it too great a favour done us to
throw our petitions under their table, much less vouchsafe to
read them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tory.</span> You go too far;&mdash;the power of King, Lords and Commons
is uncontroulable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whig.</span> With respect to tyrannising they would make it so,
if they could, I know, but there's a good deal to be said and done
first; we have more than half the bargain to make.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tory.</span> Sure you would not go to dispute by arms with Great-Britain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whig.</span> Sure I would not suffer you to pick my pocket, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tory.</span> If I did, the law is open for you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whig.</span> I have but a poor opinion of law, when the devil sits
judge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tory.</span> What would you do then, sir, if I was to pick your
pocket?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whig.</span> Break your head, sir&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tory.</span> Sure you don't mean as you say, sir&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whig.</span> I surely do&mdash;try me, sir&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tory.</span> Excuse me, sir, I am not of your mind, I would avoid
every thing that has the appearance of rashness.&mdash;Great-Britain's
power, sir&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whig.</span> Great-Britain's power, sir, is too much magnified,
't will soon grow weak, by endeavouring to make slaves of
American freemen; we are not Africans yet, neither bond-slaves.&mdash;You
would avoid and discourage every thing that has the
appearance of patriotism, you mean.&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tory.</span> Who? me, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whig.</span> Yes, you, sir;&mdash;you go slyly pimping, spying and
sneaking about, cajoling the ignorant, and insinuating bugbear
notions of Great-Britain's mighty power into weak people's ears,
that we may tamely give all up, and you be rewarded, perhaps,
with the office of judge of the admiralty, or continental hangman,
for ought I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tory.</span> Who? me, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whig.</span> Aye, you, sir;&mdash;and let me tell you, sir, you've been
long suspected&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tory.</span> Of what, sir?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whig.</span> For a rank Tory, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tory.</span> What mean you, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whig.</span> I repeat it again&mdash;suspected to be an enemy to your
country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tory.</span> By whom, sir? Can you show me an instance?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whig.</span> From your present discourse I suspect you&mdash;and from
your connections and artful behaviour all suspect you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tory.</span> Can you give me a proof?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whig.</span> Not a point blank proof, as to my own knowledge;
you're so much of a Jesuit, you have put it out of my power;&mdash;but
strong circumstances by information, such as amount to a
proof in the present case, sir, I can furnish you with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tory.</span> Sir, you may be mistaken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whig.</span> 'Tis not possible, my informant knows you too well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tory.</span> Who is your informant, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whig.</span> A gentleman, sir; and if you'll give yourself the trouble
to walk with me, I'll soon produce him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tory.</span> Another time; I cannot stay now;&mdash;'tis dinner time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whig.</span> That's the time to find him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tory.</span> I cannot stay now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whig.</span> We'll call at your house then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tory.</span> I dine abroad, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whig.</span> Be gone, you scoundrel! I'll watch your waters;
'tis time to clear the land of such infernal vermin.</p>

<p class="center gap2"><span class="smcap">Scene</span> VI. <i><span class="smcap">Roger</span> and <span class="smcap">Dick</span>, two shepherds near Lexington, after
the defeat and flight of the Regulars.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Whilst early looking, Dick, ere the sun was seen
to tinge the brow of the mountain, for my flock of sheep, nor
dreaming of approaching evil, suddenly mine eyes beheld from
yon hill a cloud of dust arise at a small distance; the intermediate
space were thick set with laurels, willows, evergreens, and bushes
of various kinds, the growth of wild nature, and which hid the
danger from my eyes, thinking perchance my flock had thither
stray'd; I descended, and straight onward went; but, Dick,
judge you my thoughts at such a disappointment: Instead of
my innocent flock of sheep, I found myself almost encircled by a
herd of ravenous British wolves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Dangerous must have been your situation, Roger,
whatever were your thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> I soon discovered my mistake; finding a hostile
appearance, I instantly turn'd myself about, and fled to alarm
the shepherds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Did they pursue you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> They did; but having the start, and being acquainted
with the by-ways, I presently got clear of their voracious jaws.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> A lucky escape, indeed, Roger; and what route did they
take after that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Onwards, t'wards Lexington, devouring geese, cattle
and swine, with fury and rage, which, no doubt, was increased by
their disappointment; and what may appear strange to you
Dick (tho' no more strange than true), is, they seem'd to be
possessed of a kind of brutish music, growling something like our
favourite tune Yankee Doodle (perhaps in ridicule), till it were
almost threadbare, seeming vastly pleased (monkey-like) with
their mimickry, as tho' it provoked us much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Nature, Roger, has furnish'd some brute animals with
voices, or, more properly speaking, with organs of sound that
nearly resemble the human. I have heard of crocodiles weeping
like a child, to decoy the unwary traveller, who is no sooner
within their reach, but they seize and devour instantly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Very true, Dick, I have read of the same; and these
wolves, being of the canine breed, and having the properties of
blood-hounds, no doubt are possess'd of a more acute sense of
smelling, more reason, instinct, sagacity, or what shall I call it?
than all other brutes. It might have been a piece of cunning of
theirs, peculiar to them, to make themselves pass for shepherds,
and decoy our flocks; for, as you know, Dick, all our shepherds
both play and sing Yankee Doodle, our sheep and lambs are as
well acquainted with that tune as ourselves, and always make
up to us whene'er they hear the sound.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Yes, Roger; and now you put me in mind of it I'll tell
you of something surprising in my turn: I have an old ram and
an old ewe, that, whenever they sing Yankee Doodle together,
a skilful musician can scarcely distinguish it from the bass and
tenor of an organ.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Surprising indeed, Dick, nor do I in the least doubt it;
and why not, as well as Balaam's ass, speak? and I might add,
many other asses, now-a-days; and yet, how might that music
be improved by a judicious disposition of its various parts, by
the addition of a proper number of sheep and young lambs;
't would then likewise resemble the counter, counter tenor, treble,
and finest pipes of an organ, and might be truly called nature's
organ; methinks, Dick, I could forever sit and hear such music,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Where all the parts in complication roll,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And with its charming music feast the soul!</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Delightful, indeed; I'll attempt it with what little skill
I have in music; we may then defy these wolves to imitate it,
and thereby save our flocks: I am well convinced, Roger, these
wolves intended it rather as a decoy than by way of ridicule,
because they live by cunning and deception; besides, they could
never mean to ridicule a piece of music, a tune, of which such
brutes cannot be supposed to be judges, and, which is allowed
by the best masters of music to be a composition of the most sublime
kind, and would have done honour to a Handel or a Correllius.
Well, go on, Roger, I long to hear the whole.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> When they came to Lexington, where a flock of our
innocent sheep and young lambs, as usual, were feeding and
sporting on the plain, these dogs of violence and rapine with
haughty stride advanc'd, and berated them in a new and unheard
of language to us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> I suppose learn'd at their own fam'd universities&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> No doubt; they had teachers among them&mdash;two old
wolves their leaders, not unlike in features to Smith and Pitcairn,
as striving to outvie each other in the very dregs of brutal eloquence,
and more than Billingsgate jargon, howl'd in their ears
such a peal of new-fangled execrations, and hell-invented oratory,
till that day unheard in New-England, as struck the whole flock
with horror, and made them for a while stand aghast, as tho'
all the wolves in the forest had broke loose upon them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Oh, shocking!&mdash;Roger, go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Not content with this, their murdering leaders, with
premeditated malice, keen appetite, and without provocation,
gave the howl for the onset, when instantly the whole herd, as if
the devil had entered into them, ran violently down the hill, and
fixed their talons and jaws upon them, and as quick as lightning
eight innocent young lambs fell a sacrifice to their fury, and victims
to their rapacity; the very houses of our God were no longer
a sanctuary; many they tore to pieces, and some at the very foot
of the altar; others were dragged out as in a wanton, gamesome
mood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Barbarity inexpressible! more than savage cruelty! I
hope you'll make their master pay for 'em; there is a law of this
province, Roger, which obliges the owner of such dogs to pay for
the mischief they do.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> I know it, Dick; he shall pay, never fear, and that
handsomely too; he has paid part of it already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Who is their master, Roger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> One Lord Paramount; they call him a free-booter;
a fellow who pretends to be proprietor of all America, and says
he has a deed for it, and chief ranger of all the flocks, and pretends
to have a patent for it; has been a long time in the practice
of killing and stealing sheep in England and Ireland, and had
like to have been hang'd for it there, but was reprieved by the
means of his friend <i>George</i>&mdash;I forgot his other name&mdash;not
Grenville&mdash;not George the Second&mdash;but another George&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> It's no matter, he'll be hang'd yet; he has sent his dogs
to a wrong place, and lugg'd the wrong sow by the ear; he should
have sent them to Newfoundland, or Kamchatka, there's no
sheep there&mdash;But never mind, go on, Roger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Nor was their voracious appetites satiated there;
they rush'd into the town of Concord, and proceeded to devour
every thing that lay in their way; and those brute devils, like
Sampson's foxes (and as tho' they were men), thrice attempted
with firebrands to destroy our corn, our town-house and habitations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Heavens! Could not all this provoke you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> It did; rage prompted us at length, and found us
arms 'gainst such hellish mischief to oppose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Oh, would I had been there!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Our numbers increasing, and arm'd with revenge, we
in our turn play'd the man; they, unus'd to wounds, with hideous
yelling soon betook themselves to a precipitate and confused
flight, nor did we give o'er the chase, till Ph&oelig;bus grew drowsy,
bade us desist, and wished us a good night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Of some part of their hasty retreat I was a joyful
spectator, I saw their tongues lolling out of their mouths, and
heard them pant like hunted wolves indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Did you not hear how their mirth was turn'd into
mourning? their fury into astonishment? how soon they quitted
their howling Yankee Doodle, and chang'd their notes to bellowing?
how nimbly (yet against their will) they betook themselves
to dancing? And he was then the bravest dog that beat time
the swiftest, and footed Yankee Doodle the nimblest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Well pleased, Roger, was I with the chase, and glorious
sport it was: I oft perceiv'd them tumbling o'er each other heels<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
over head; nor did one dare stay to help his brother&mdash;but,
with bloody breech, made the best of his way&mdash;nor ever stopped
till they were got safe within their lurking-holes&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> From whence they have not the courage to peep out,
unless four to one, except (like a skunk) forc'd by famine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> May this be the fate of all those prowling sheep-stealers,
it behooves the shepherds to double the watch, to take uncommon
precaution and care of their tender flocks, more especially as
this is like to be an uncommon severe winter, by the appearance
of wolves, so early in the season&mdash;but, hark!&mdash;Roger, methinks
I hear the sound of melody warbling thro' the grove&mdash;Let's sit a
while, and partake of it unseen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> With all my heart.&mdash;Most delightful harmony! This
is the First of May; our shepherds and nymphs are celebrating
our glorious St. Tammany's day; we'll hear the song out, and
then join in the frolic, and chorus it o'er and o'er again&mdash;This
day shall be devoted to joy and festivity.</p>

<p class="center gap2"><span class="smcap">Scene</span> VII. <i>In a chamber, near Boston, the morning after the
battle of Bunkers-Hill.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clarissa.</span> How lovely is this new-born day!&mdash;The sun rises
with uncommon radiance after the most gloomy night my wearied
eyes ever knew.&mdash;The voice of slumber was not heard&mdash;the angel
of sleep was fled&mdash;and the awful whispers of solemnity and
silence prevented my eye-lids from closing.&mdash;No wonder&mdash;the
terrors and ideas of yesterday&mdash;such a scene of war&mdash;of tumult&mdash;hurry
and hubbub&mdash;of horror and destruction&mdash;the direful noise
of conflict&mdash;the dismal hissing of iron shot in volleys flying&mdash;such
bellowing of mortars&mdash;such thund'ring of cannon&mdash;such
roaring of musketry&mdash;and such clashing of swords and bayonets&mdash;such
cries of the wounded&mdash;and such streams of blood&mdash;such a
noise and crush of houses, steeples, and whole streets of desolate
Charlestown falling&mdash;pillars of fire, and the convulsed vortex
of fiery flakes, rolling in flaming wreaths in the air, in dreadful
combustion, seemed as tho' the elements and whole earth were
envelop'd in one general, eternal conflagration and total ruin,
and intermingled with black smoke, ascending, on the wings of
mourning, up to Heaven, seemed piteously to implore the Al<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>mighty
interposition to put a stop to such devastation, lest the
whole earth should be unpeopled in the unnatural conflict&mdash;Too,
too much for female heroism to dwell upon&mdash;But what are all
those to the terrors that filled my affrighted imagination the
last night?&mdash;Dreams&mdash;fancies&mdash;evil bodings&mdash;shadows, phantoms
and ghastly visions continually hovering around my pillow,
goading and harrowing my soul with the most terrific appearances,
not imaginary, but real&mdash;Am I awake?&mdash;Where are the
British murderers?&mdash;where's my husband?&mdash;my son?&mdash;my
brother?&mdash;Something more than human tells me all is not well:
If they are among the slain, 'tis impossible.&mdash;I&mdash;Oh! [<i>She cries.</i>]</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter a <span class="smcap">Neighbour</span></i> [<i>a spectator of the battle</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neighbour.</span> Madam, grieve not so much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clarissa.</span> Am I wont to grieve without a cause? Wou'd
to God I did;&mdash;mock me not&mdash;What voice is that? methinks I
know it&mdash;some angel sent to comfort me?&mdash;welcome then. [<i>She
turns about.</i>] Oh, my Neighbour, is it you? My friend, I have
need of comfort. Hast thou any for me?&mdash;say&mdash;will you not

thou seen them since the battle? Oh! bring me not unwelcome

<p><span class="smcap">Neighbour.</span> [<i>Aside. What shall I say?</i>] Madam, I beheld
them yesterday from an eminence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clarissa.</span> Upon that very eminence was I. What then?&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neighbour.</span> I saw the brave man Warren, your son and
brother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clarissa.</span> What? O ye gods!&mdash;Speak on friend&mdash;stop&mdash;what
saw ye?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neighbour.</span> In the midst of the tempest of war&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clarissa.</span> Where are they now?&mdash;That I saw too&mdash;What is
all this?</p>

their front to the&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clarissa.</span> Oh, trifle not with me&mdash;dear Neighbour!&mdash;where

<p><span class="smcap">Neighbour.</span> [<i>Aside. Heavens! must I tell her!</i>] Madam, be
patient&mdash;right and left, that all may see who hate us, we are
prepar'd for them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clarissa.</span> What then?&mdash;Can you find 'em?&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neighbour.</span> I saw Warren and the other two heroes firm as
Roxbury stand the shock of the enemy's fiercest attacks, and
twice put to flight their boasted phalanx.&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clarissa.</span> All that I saw, and more; say&mdash;wou'd they not
come to me, were they well?&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neighbour.</span> Madam, hear me&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clarissa.</span> Oh! he will not speak.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neighbour.</span> The enemy return'd to the charge, and stumbling
o'er the dead and wounded bodies of their friends, Warren
received them with indissoluble firmness, and notwithstanding
their battalious aspect, in the midst of the battle, tho' surrounded
with foes on ev'ry side&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clarissa.</span> Oh, my Neighbour!&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neighbour.</span> Madam&mdash;his nervous arm, like a giant refresh'd
with wine, hurl'd destruction where'er he came, breathing heroic
ardour to advent'rous deeds, and long time in even scale the
battle hung, till at last death turn'd pale and affrighted at the
carnage&mdash;they ran&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clarissa.</span> Who ran?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neighbour.</span> The enemy, Madam, gave way&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clarissa.</span> Warren never ran&mdash;yet&mdash;oh! I wou'd he had&mdash;I
fear&mdash;[<i>Cries.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neighbour.</span> I say not so, Madam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clarissa.</span> What say ye then? he was no coward, Neighbour&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neighbour.</span> Brave to the last. [<i>Aside. I forgot myself.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clarissa.</span> What said you? O Heavens! brave to the last!
those words&mdash;why do you keep me thus?&mdash;cruel&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neighbour.</span> [<i>Aside. She will know it.</i>] I say, Madam, by some
mistaken orders on our side, the enemy rallied and return'd to
the charge with fresh numbers, and your husband, son, and
brother&mdash;Madam&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clarissa.</span> Stop!&mdash;O ye powers!&mdash;What?&mdash;say no more&mdash;yet
let me hear&mdash;keep me not thus&mdash;tell me, I charge thee&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neighbour.</span> [<i>Aside. I can hold no longer, she must know it.</i>]
Forgive me, Madam&mdash;I saw them fall&mdash;and Michael, the archangel,
who vanquish'd Satan, is not more immortal than they.
[<i>Aside. Who can relate such woes without a tear?</i>],</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clarissa.</span> Oh! I've heard enough&mdash;too&mdash;too much [<i>Cries.</i>]
yet&mdash;if thou hast worse to tell&mdash;say on&mdash;nought worse can be&mdash;O
ye gods!&mdash;cruel&mdash;cruel&mdash;thrice cruel&mdash;cou'd ye not leave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
me one&mdash;[<i>She faints, and is caught by her friend, and placed
in a chair; he rings the bell, the family come in, and endeavour to
bring her to.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neighbour.</span> With surprising fortitude she heard the melancholy
relation, until I came to the last close&mdash;she then gave me
a mournful look, lifted up her eyes, and immediately sunk motionless
into my arms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Woman.</span> Poor soul!&mdash;no wonder&mdash;how I sympathize with her
in her distress&mdash;my tender bosom can scarcely bear the sight!
A dreadful loss! a most shocking scene it was, that brothers
should with brothers war, and in intestine fierce opposition meet,
to seek the blood of each other, like dogs for a bare bone, who so
oft in generous friendship and commerce join'd, in festivals of
love and joy unanimous as the sons of one kind and indulgent
father, and separately would freely in a good cause spend their
blood and sacrifice their lives for him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neighbour.</span> A terrible black day it was, and ever will be
remembered by New-England, when that vile Briton (unworthy
the name of a Briton), Lord Boston (curse the name!), whose
horrid murders stain American soil with blood; perish his name!
a fratricide! 'twas he who fir'd Charlestown, and spread desolation,
fire, flames and smoke in ev'ry corner&mdash;he was the wretch,
that waster of the world, that licens'd robber, that blood-stain'd
insulter of a free people, who bears the name of Lord Boston,
but from henceforth shall be called Cain, that pillag'd the ruins,
and dragg'd and murder'd the infant, the aged and infirm&mdash;(But
look, she recovers.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clarissa.</span> O ye angels! ye cherubims and seraphims! waft
their souls to bliss, bathe their wounds with angelic balsam, and
crown them with immortality. A faithful, loving and beloved
husband, a promising and filial son, a tender and affectionate
brother: Alas! what a loss!&mdash;Whom have I now to comfort me?&mdash;What
have I left, but the voice of lamentation: [<i>She weeps.</i>]
Ill-fated bullets&mdash;these tears shall sustain me&mdash;yes, ye dear
friends! how gladly wou'd I follow you&mdash;but alas! I must still
endure tribulation and inquietudes, from which you are now
exempt; I cannot cease to weep, ye brave men, I will mourn
your fall&mdash;weep on&mdash;flow, mine eyes, and wash away their
blood, till the fountain of sorrow is dried up&mdash;but, oh! it never&mdash;never
will&mdash;my sympathetic soul shall dwell on your bosoms,
and floods of tears shall water your graves; and since all other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
comfort is deny'd me, deprive me not of the only consolation
left me of meditating on your virtues and dear memories, who
fell in defense of liberty and your country&mdash;ye brave men&mdash;ye
more than friends&mdash;ye martyrs to liberty!&mdash;This, this is all I
ask, till sorrow overwhelms me.&mdash;I breathe my last; and ye
yourselves, your own bright spirits, come and waft me to your
peaceful abode, where the voice of lamentation is not heard,
neither shall we know any more what it is to separate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidnapper.</span> What's your will, Boatswain?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boatswain.</span> I beg your Lordship's pardon [<i>Aside. But you
can soon fetch up Leeway, and spread the water sail again.</i>], please
your honour, here's a boat full of fine recruits along side for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidnapper.</span> Recruits, Boatswain? you mean soldiers from
Augustine, I imagine; what reg'mentals have they on?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boatswain.</span> Mourning, please your honour, and as black as
our tarpawling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidnapper.</span> Ha, ha, well well, take 'em on board, Boatswain,
I'll be on deck presently.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boatswain.</span> With submission to your honour, d' ye see,
[<i>Scratching his head.</i>] I think we have gallows-looking dogs
enough on board already&mdash;the scrapings of Newgate, and the
refuse of Tyburn, and when the wind blows aft, damn 'em, they
stink like polecats&mdash;but d' ye see, as your honour pleases, with
submission, if it's Lord Paramount's orders, why it must be so,
I suppose&mdash;but I've done my duty, d' ye see&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidnapper.</span> Ha, ha, the work must be done, Boatswain, no
matter by whom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boatswain.</span> Why, aye, that's true, please your honour, any
port in a storm&mdash;if a man is to be hang'd, or have his throat cut,
d' ye see&mdash;who are so fit to do it as his own slaves? especially as
they're to have their freedoms for it; nobody can blame 'em,
nor your honour neither, for you get them for half price, or
nothing at all, d' ye see me, and that will help to lessen poor
Owld England's taxes, and when you have done with 'em here,
and they get their brains knock'd out, d' ye see, your honour can
sell them in the West-Indies, and that will be something in your
honour's pocket, d' ye see&mdash;well, ev'ry man to his trade&mdash;but,

it&mdash;d' ye see.</p>

<p class="center gap2"><span class="smcap">Scene</span> III. <i><span class="smcap">Lord Kidnapper</span> returns to his state-room; the
<span class="smcap">Boatswain</span> comes on deck and pipes.</i></p>

<p>All hands ahoy&mdash;hand a rope, some of you Tories, forward
there, for his worship's reg'ment of black guards to come aboard.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Negroes</span>.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boatswain.</span> Your humble servant, Gentlemen, I suppose
you want to see Lord Kidnapper?&mdash;Clear the gangway there of
them Tyburn tulips. Please to walk aft, brother soldiers, that's
the fittest birth for you, the Kidnapper's in the state-room, he'll
hoist his sheet-anchor presently, he'll be up in a jiffin&mdash;as soon
as he has made fast the end of his small rope athwart Jenny
Bluegarter and Kate Common's stern posts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Sailor.</span> Damn my eyes, but I suppose, messmate, we
must bundle out of our hammocks this cold weather, to make
room for these black regulars to stow in, tumble upon deck, and
choose a soft berth among the snow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Sailor.</span> Blast 'em, if they come within a cable's length
of my hammock, I'll kick 'em to hell through one of the gun ports.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boatswain.</span> Come, come, brothers, don't be angry, I suppose
we shall soon be in a warmer latitude&mdash;the Kidnapper seems as
fond of these black regulars (as you call 'em, Jack) as he is of the
brace of whores below; but as they come in so damn'd slow, I'll
put him in the humour of sending part of the fleet this winter to
the coast of Guinea, and beat up for volunteers, there he'll get
recruits enough for a hogshead or two of New-England rum, and
a few owld pipe-shanks, and save poor Owld-England the trouble
and expense of clothing them in the bargain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Sailor.</span> Aye, <span class="smcap">Boatswain</span>, any voyage, so it's a warm
one&mdash;if it's to hell itself&mdash;for I'm sure the devil must be better
off than we, if we are to stay here this winter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Sailor.</span> Any voyage, so it's to the southward, rather
than stay here at lazy anchor&mdash;no fire, nothing to eat or drink,
but suck our frosty fists like bears, unless we turn sheep-stealers
again, and get our brains knock'd out. Eigh, master cook, you're
a gentleman now&mdash;nothing to do&mdash;grown so proud, you won't
speak to poor folks, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cook.</span> The devil may cook for 'em for me&mdash;if I had any thing
to cook&mdash;a parcel of frozen half-starv'd dogs. I should never
be able to keep 'em out of the cook room, or their noses out of
the slush-tub.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boatswain.</span> Damn your old smoky jaws, you're better off
than any man aboard, your trouble will be nothing,&mdash;for I suppose
they'll be disbursted in different messes among the Tories,
and it's only putting on the big pot, cockey. Ha, ha, ha.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cook.</span> What signifies, Mr. Boatswain, the big pot or the
little pot, if there's nothing to cook? no fire, coal or wood to cook
with? Blast my eyes, Mr. Boatswain, if I disgrease myself so
much, I have had the honour, damn me (tho' I say it that
shou'dn't say it) to be chief cook of a seventy-four gun ship, on
board of which was Lord Abel-Marl and Admiral Poke-Cock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boatswain.</span> Damn the liars&mdash;old singe-the-devil&mdash;you chief
cook of a seventy-four gun ship, eigh? you the devil, you're as
proud as hell, for all you look as old as Matheg'lum, hand a pair
of silk stockings for our cook here, d' ye see&mdash;lash a handspike
athwart his arse, get a ladle full of slush and a handful of brimstone
for his hair, and step one of you Tories there for the devil's
barber to come and shave and dress him. Ha, ha, ha.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cook.</span> No, Mr. Boatswain, it's not pride&mdash;but look 'e (as I
said before), I'll not disgrease my station, I'll throw up my commission,
before I'll stand cook for a parcel of scape gallows, convict
Tory dogs and run-away Negroes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boatswain.</span> What's that you say? Take care, old frosty
face&mdash;What? do you accuse his worship of turning kidnapper,
and harbouring run-away Negroes?&mdash;Softly, or you'll be taken
up for a Whig, and get a handsome coat of slush and hog's feathers
for a christmas-box, cockey: Throw up your commission, eigh?
throw up the pot-halliards, you mean, old piss-to-windward?
Ha, ha, ha.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cook.</span> I tell you, Mr. Boatswain&mdash;I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boatswain.</span> Come, come, give us a chaw of tobacco, Cook&mdash;
blast your eyes, don't take any pride in what I say&mdash;I'm only
joking, d' ye see&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cook.</span> Well, but Mr. Boatswain&mdash;&mdash;</p>

you a greater man than your master, and if I find the rest of you
behave well, I'll make you all officers, and after you have serv'd
Lord Paramount a while, you shall have money in your pockets,

<p class="center"><i><span class="smcap">Lord Kidnapper</span>, <span class="smcap">Captain Squires</span>, and <span class="smcap">Chaplain</span>.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidnapper.</span> These blacks are no small acquisition, them and
the Tories we have on board will strengthen us vastly; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
thoughts of emancipation will make 'em brave, and the encouragement
given them by my proclamation, will greatly intimidate
the rebels&mdash;internal enemies are worse than open foes.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chaplain.</span> Very true, My Lord; David prayed that he might
be preserved from secret enemies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidnapper.</span> Aye, so I've heard, but I look upon this to be a
grand man&oelig;uvre in politics; this is making dog eat dog&mdash;thief
catch thief&mdash;the servant against his master&mdash;rebel against rebel&mdash;what
think you of that, parson?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chaplain.</span> A house divided thus against itself cannot stand,
according to scripture&mdash;My Lord, your observation is truly
scriptural.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidnapper.</span> Scripture? poh, poh&mdash;I've nothing to do with
scripture&mdash;I mean politically, parson.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chaplain.</span> I know it very well; sure, My Lord, I understand
you perfectly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidnapper.</span> Faith that's all I care for; if we can stand our
ground this winter, and burn all their towns that are accessible
to our ships, and Colonel Connolly succeeds in his plan, there's
not the least doubt but we shall have supplies from England very
early in the spring, which I have wrote for; then, in conjunction
with Connolly, we shall be able to make a descent where we
please, and drive the rebels like hogs into a pen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chaplain.</span> And then gather them (as the scriptures say) as
a hen gathereth her chickens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidnapper.</span> True, Mr. Scripture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Captain Squires.</span> Very good, but you must take care of the
hawks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidnapper.</span> What do you mean by the hawks, Captain?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Captain Squires.</span> I mean the shirt-men, the rifle-men, My Lord.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidnapper.</span> Aye, damn 'em, hawks indeed; they are cursed
dogs; a man is never safe where they are, but I'll take care to be
out of their reach, let others take their chance, for I see they
have no respect to persons&mdash;I suppose they wou'd shoot at me,
if I were within their reach.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chaplain.</span> Undoubtedly, they would be more fond of you
than of a wild turkey; a parcel of ignorant, unmannerly rascals,
they pay no more respect to a Lord than they wou'd to a devil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidnapper.</span> The scoundrels are grown so damn'd impudent
too, that one can scarcely get a roasting pig now-a-days, but I'll
be even with some of 'em by and by.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chaplain.</span> I hope we shall get something good for our Christmas
dinner&mdash;so much abstinence and involuntary mortification,
cannot be good for the soul&mdash;a war in the body corporal is of
more dangerous consequence than a civil war to the state, or
heresy and schism to the church.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidnapper.</span> Very true, parson&mdash;very true&mdash;now I like your
doctrine&mdash;a full belly is better than an empty sermon; preach
that doctrine;&mdash;stick to that text, and you'll not fail of making
converts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chaplain.</span> The wisest of men said, there is nothing better,
than that a man should enjoy that which he hath, namely, eat,
drink, and be merry, if he can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidnapper.</span> You're very right&mdash;Solomon was no fool, they
say&mdash;[<i>He sings.</i>]</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Give me a charming lass, Twangdillo cries,</i><br /></span>

<p>Yet two is better than one, my Lord, for the scriptures further
say, if one be alone, how can there be heat? You seem to be
converted to that belief, for you have a brace of them, as the

the battle of Bunker's-Hill.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lord Boston</span>, <span class="smcap">Admiral Tombstone</span>, <span class="smcap">Elbow Room</span>,
<span class="smcap">Mr. Caper</span>, <span class="smcap">General Clinton</span>, <span class="smcap">Earl Percy.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Boston.</span> I fully expected, with the help of the last
reinforcement you brought me over, and the advice and assistance
of three accomplish'd and experienc'd Generals, I should have
been able to have subdued the rebels, and gain'd immortal laurels
to myself&mdash;have return'd to Old England like a Roman Consul,
with a score or two of the rebel Generals, Colonels and Majors,
to have grac'd my triumph.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elbow Room.</span> You have been vastly disappointed, sir&mdash;you
must not look for laurels (unless wild ones) nor expect triumphs
(unless sham ones) from your own victories or conquests in
America.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Boston.</span> And yet, not more disappointed than you, sir&mdash;witness
your thrasonical speeches on your first landing, provided
you had but elbow room&mdash;and Mr. Caper too, to bring over
Monsieur Rigadoon, the dancing-master, and Signor Rosin,
the fiddler forsooth; he thought, no doubt, to have country
danc'd the rebels out of their liberty with some of his new cuts&mdash;with
his soft music to have fascinated their wives and daughters,
and with some of 'em, no doubt, to have taken the tour of
America, with his reg'ment of fine, sleek, prancing horses, that
have been feeding this six months on codfish tails; he thought
to have grown fat with feasting, dancing, and drinking tea with
the Ladies, instead of being the skeleton he now appears to be&mdash;not
to mention any thing of his letter, wherein he laments Tom's
absence; for<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> "had Tom been with him (he says) he wou'd have
been out of danger, and quite secure from the enemy's shot."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span> I think, Gentlemen, we're even with you now; you
have had your mirth and frolic with us, for dancing "Yankee
Doodle," as you called it, from Lexington.&mdash;I find you have
had a severer dance, a brave sweat at Bunker's Hill, and have
been obliged to pay the fiddler in the bargain.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clinton.</span> However, Gentlemen, I approve (at proper seasons)
of a little joking, yet I can by no means think (as we have had
such bad success with our crackers) that this is a proper time to
throw your squibs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Boston.</span> I grant you, sir, this is a very improper time
for joking; for my part, I was only speaking as to my own
thoughts, when Mr. Elbow Room made remarks, which he might
as well have spared.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elbow Room.</span> I took you, sir, as meaning a reflection upon
us for our late great loss, and particularly to myself, for expressing
some surprise on our first landing, that you should suffer a parcel
of ignorant peasants to drive you before 'em like sheep from
Lexington; and I must own I was a little chagrin'd at your seeming
so unconcern'd at such an affair as this (which had nearly
prov'd our ruin), by your innuendoes and ironical talk of accomplish'd
Generals, Roman Consuls and triumphs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Boston.</span> My mentioning accomplish'd Generals, surely,
sir, was rather a compliment to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elbow Room.</span> When irony pass current for compliments,
and we take it so, I shall have no objection to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Caper.</span> The affair of Lexington, My Lord Boston, at
which you were so much affrighted (if I am rightly inform'd),
was because you then stood on your own bottom, this of Bunker's
Hill you seem secretly to rejoice at, only because you have three
accomplish'd and experienc'd Generals to share the disgrace with
you, besides the brave Admiral Tombstone&mdash;you talk of dancing
and fiddling, and yet you do neither, as I see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Boston.</span> And pray, sir, what did you do with the commission,
the post, the Duke of Grafton gave you, in lieu of your
losses at Preston election, and the expenses of your trial at the
king's bench for a riot, which had emptied your pockets?&mdash;Why
you sold it&mdash;you sold it, sir&mdash;to raise cash to gamble with.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Admiral Tombstone.</span> Damn it, don't let us kick up a dust
among ourselves, to be laugh'd at fore and aft&mdash;this is a hell of
a council of war&mdash;though I believe it will turn out one before
we've done&mdash;a scolding and quarrelling like a parcel of damn'd
butter whores&mdash;I never heard two whores yet scold and quarrel,
but they got to fighting at last.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clinton.</span> Pray, Gentlemen, drop this discourse, consider the
honour of England is at stake, and our own safety depends upon
this day's consultation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Boston.</span> 'Tis not for argument's sake&mdash;but the dignity
of my station requires others should give up first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elbow Room.</span> Sir, I have done, lest you should also accuse
me of obstructing the proceedings of the council of war.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Caper.</span> For the same reason I drop it now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Boston.</span> Well, Gentlemen, what are we met here for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Admiral Tombstone.</span> Who the devil shou'd know, if you
don't?&mdash;damn it, didn't you send for us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Boston.</span> Our late great loss of men has tore up the
foundation of our plan, and render'd all further attempts impracticable&mdash;'t
will be a long time ere we can expect any more reinforcements&mdash;and
if they should arrive, I'm doubtful of their
success.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clinton.</span> The provincials are vastly strong, and seem no
novices in the art of war; 'tis true we gain'd the hill at last,
but of what advantage is it to us?&mdash;none&mdash;the loss of 1400 as
brave men as Britain can boast of, is a melancholy consideration,
and must make our most sanguinary friends in England abate
of their vigour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elbow Room.</span> I never saw or read of any battle equal to it&mdash;never
was more martial courage display'd, and the provincials,
to do the dogs justice, fought like heroes, fought indeed more like
devils than men; such carnage and destruction not exceeded by
Blenheim, Minden, Fontenoy, Ramillies, Dettingen, the battle
of the Boyne, and the late affair of the Spaniards and Algerines&mdash;a
mere cock-fight to it&mdash;no laurels there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Caper.</span> No, nor triumphs neither&mdash;I regret in particular
the number of brave officers that fell that day, many of whom
were of the first families in England.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Admiral Tombstone.</span> Aye, a damn'd affair indeed&mdash;many
powder'd beaus&mdash;petit maitres&mdash;fops&mdash;fribbles&mdash;skip jacks&mdash;macaronies&mdash;jack
puddings&mdash;noblemen's bastards and whores'
sons fell that day&mdash;and my poor marines stood no more chance
with 'em than a cat in hell without claws.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Boston.</span> It can't be help'd, Admiral; what is to be done
next?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Admiral Tombstone.</span> Done?&mdash;why, what the devil have you
done? nothing yet, but eat Paramount's beef, and steal a few
Yankee sheep&mdash;and that, it seems, is now become a damn'd
lousy, beggarly trade too, for you hav'n't left yourselves a mouthful
to eat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>

a war with the guts) or what you will&mdash;but I call it a council of
famine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Boston.</span> As it's so late, Gentlemen, we'll adjourn the

<p class="center gap2"><span class="smcap">Scene</span> I. <i>At Montreal.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i><span class="smcap">General Prescot</span> and <span class="smcap">Officer</span>.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">General Prescot.</span></p>

<p>So it seems indeed, one misfortune seldom comes alone.&mdash;The
rebels, after the taking of Ticonderoga and Chamblee,
as I just now learn by a Savage, marched immediately to besiege
St. John's, and are now before that place, closely investing it, and
no doubt intend paying us a visit soon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> Say you so? then 'tis time to look about us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Prescot.</span> They'll find us prepar'd, I'll warrant 'em,
to give 'em such a reception as they little dream of&mdash;a parcel of
Yankee dogs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> Their success, no doubt, has elated them, and
given 'em hopes of conquering all Canada soon, if that's their
intent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Prescot.</span> No doubt it is&mdash;but I'll check their career
a little.&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Scouting Officer</span>, with <span class="smcap">Colonel Allen</span>,
and other prisoners.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scouting Officer.</span> Sir, I make bold to present you with a
few prisoners&mdash;they are a scouting detachment from the army
besieging St. John's.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Prescot.</span> Prisoners? Rebels, I suppose, and scarcely
worth hanging.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col. Allen.</span> Sir, you suppose wrong&mdash;you mean scarcely
worth your while to attempt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Prescot.</span> Pray, who are you, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col. Allen.</span> A man, sir, and who had the honour, till now,
to command those brave men, whom you call rebels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Prescot.</span> What is your name? If I may be so bold?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col. Allen.</span> Allen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Prescot.</span> Allen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col. Allen.</span> Yes, Allen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Prescot.</span> Are you that Allen, that Colonel Allen (as
they call him) that dar'd to take Ticonderoga?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col. Allen.</span> The same&mdash;the very man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Prescot.</span> Then rebels you are, and as such I shall treat
you, for daring to oppose Lord Paramount's troops, and the laws
of the land.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col. Allen.</span> Prisoners we are, 'tis true&mdash;but we despise the
name of a rebel&mdash;With more propriety that name is applicable
to your master&mdash;'tis he who attempts to destroy the laws of the
land, not us&mdash;we mean to support them, and defend our property
against Paramount's and parliamentary tyranny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Prescot.</span> To answer you were a poorness of spirit I
despise; when rebels dare accuse, power that replies, forgets
to punish; I am not to argue that point with you: And let me
tell you, sir, whoever you are, it now ill becomes you thus to talk&mdash;You're
my prisoner&mdash;your life is in my hands, and you shall
suffer immediately&mdash;Guards! take them away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col. Allen.</span> Cruel insult!&mdash;pardon these brave men!&mdash;what
they have done has been by my orders&mdash;I am the only guilty
person (if guilt there be), let me alone suffer for them all. [<i>Opening
his breast.</i>] Here! take your revenge&mdash;Why do you hesitate?&mdash;Will
you not strike a breast that ne'er will flinch from
your pointed bayonet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Prescot.</span> Provoke me not&mdash;Remember you're my
prisoners.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col. Allen.</span> Our souls are free!&mdash;Strike, cowards, strike!&mdash;I
scorn to beg my life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Prescot.</span> Guards! away with them&mdash;I'll reserve you
for a more ignominious death&mdash;your fate is fix'd&mdash;away with
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col. Allen.</span> [<i>Going off.</i>] Be glutted, ye thirsters after human
blood&mdash;Come, see me suffer&mdash;mark my eye, and scorn me, if my
expiring soul confesses fear&mdash;Come, see and be taught virtue,
and to die as a patriot for the wrongs of my country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col. Allen.</span> What, do you mean to torture us to death with
chains, racks and gibbets? rather despatch us immediately&mdash;Ye
executioners, ye inquisitors, does this cruelty proceed from the
lenity I shewed to the prisoners I took?&mdash;Did it offend you that I
treated them with friendship, generosity, honour and humanity?&mdash;If
it did, our suff'rings will redound more to our honour, and
our fall be the more glorious&mdash;But remember, this fall will prove
your own one day&mdash;Wretches! I fear you not, do your worst; and

floor, I'll yet pray for your conversion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>

<p class="center gap2"><span class="smcap">Scene</span> III. <i>In the Camp at Cambridge.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i><span class="smcap">General Washington</span>, <span class="smcap">General Lee</span>, and <span class="smcap">General Putnam</span>.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">General Washington.</span></p>

<p>Our accounts from the Northward, so far, are very favourable;
Ticonderoga, Chamblee, St. John's and Montreal our troops are
already in possession of&mdash;and Colonel Arnold, having penetrated
Canada, after suff'ring much thro' cold, fatigue and want of provisions,
is now before Quebec, and General Montgomery, I understand,
is in full march to join him; see these letters.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>They read.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Lee.</span> The brave, the intrepid Arnold, with his handful
of fearless troops, have dar'd beyond the strength of mortals&mdash;Their
courage smil'd at doubts, and resolutely march'd on,
clamb'ring (to all but themselves) insurmountable precipices,
whose tops, covered with ice and snow, lay hid in the clouds,
and dragging baggage, provisions, ammunition and artillery
along with them, by main strength, in the dead of winter, over
such stupendous and amazing heights, seems almost unparallelled
in history!&mdash;'Tis true, Hannibal's march over the Alps
comes the nearest to it&mdash;it was a surprising undertaking, but
when compar'd to this, appears but as a party of pleasure, an
agreeable walk, a sabbath day's journey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Putnam.</span> Posterity will stand amazed, and be astonish'd
at the heroes of this new world, that the spirit of patriotism
should blaze to such a height, and eclipse all others, should outbrave
fatigue, danger, pain, peril, famine and even death itself,
to serve their country; that they should march, at this inclement
season, thro' long and dreary deserts, thro' the remotest wilds,
covered with swamps and standing lakes, beset with trees, bushes
and briars, impervious to the cheering rays of the sun, where are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
no traces or vestiges of human footsteps, wild, untrodden paths,
that strike terror into the fiercest of the brute creation.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>No bird of song to cheer the gloomy desert!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>No animals of gentle love's enliven!</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Lee.</span> Let Britons do the like&mdash;no&mdash;they dare not
attempt it&mdash;let 'em call forth the Hanoverian, the Hessian, the
hardy Ruffian, or, if they will, the wild Cossacks and Kalmucks
of Tartary, and they would tremble at the thought! And who
but Americans dare undertake it? The wond'ring moon and
stars stood aloof, and turn'd pale at the sight!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Washington.</span> I rejoice to hear the Canadians received
them kindly, after their fatigue furnish'd them with the necessaries
of life, and otherways treated them very humanely&mdash;And
the savages, whose hair stood on end, and look'd and listen'd
with horror and astonishment at the relation of the fatigues and
perils they underwent, commiserated them, and afforded all
the succour in their power.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Lee.</span> The friendship of the Canadians and Savages, or
even their neutrality alone, are favourable circumstances that
cannot fail to hearten our men; and the junction of General
Montgomery will inspire 'em with fresh ardour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Putnam.</span> Heavens prosper 'em!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Officer</span> and <span class="smcap">Express</span>.</i></p>

General Montgomery join'd Colonel Arnold when you left it?</p>

gentlemen.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Gives him the letters.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Washington.</span> Very well. You may now withdraw and
refresh yourself, unless you've further to say&mdash;I'll dispatch you
shortly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Express.</span> Nothing further, sir.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Washington.</span> [<i>Opens and reads the letter to <span class="smcap">Generals
Lee</span> and <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>.</i>] I am well pleased with their contents&mdash;all but
the behaviour of the haughty Carleton&mdash;to fire upon a flag of
truce, hitherto unprecedented, even amongst Savages or Algerines&mdash;his
cruelty to the prisoners is cowardly, and personal ill
treatment of General Montgomery is unbecoming a General&mdash;a
soldier&mdash;and beneath a Gentleman&mdash;and leaves an indelible mark
of brutality&mdash;I hope General Montgomery, however, will not
follow his example.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Lee.</span> I hope so too, sir&mdash;if it can be avoided; it's a
disgrace to the soldier, and a scandal to the Gentleman&mdash;so long
as I've been a soldier, my experience has not furnish'd me with a
like instance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Putnam.</span> I see no reason why he shou'dn't be paid
in his own coin.&mdash;If a man bruises my heel, I'll break his
head&mdash;I cannot see the reason or propriety of bearing with
their insults&mdash;does he not know it's in our power to retaliate
fourfold?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Lee.</span> Let's be good natur'd, General&mdash;let us see a little
more of it first&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Putnam.</span> I think we have seen enough of it already for
this twelve-months past. Methinks the behaviour of Lord
Boston, the ill treatment of poor Allen, to be thrown into a
loathsome dungeon like a murderer, be loaded with irons, and
transported like a convict, would sufficiently rouse us to a just
retaliation&mdash;that imperious red coat, Carleton, should be taught
good manners&mdash;I hope to see him ere long in our College at
Cambridge&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Lee.</span> I doubt; he'll be too cunning, and play truant&mdash;he
has no notion of learning American manners; ev'ry dog
must have his day (as the saying is); it may be our time by and
by&mdash;the event of war is uncertain&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Putnam.</span> Very true, sir; but don't let us be laugh'd at
forever.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter an <span class="smcap">Officer</span> in haste.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> Sir, a messenger this moment from Quebec waits
to be admitted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Washington.</span> Let him enter.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Officer</span>.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Messenger</span>.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Washington.</span> What news bring you?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> I am sorry, sir, to be the bearer of an unpleasing
tale&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Washington.</span> Bad news have you?&mdash;have you letters?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> None, sir&mdash;I came off at a moment's warning&mdash;my
message is verbal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Washington.</span> Then relate what you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> After the arrival and junction of General Montgomery's
troops with Colonel Arnold's, Carleton was summoned
to surrender; he disdaining any answer, fir'd on the flag of
truce&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Washington.</span> That we have heard&mdash;go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> The General finding no breach could be effected
in any reasonable time, their walls being vastly strong, and his
cannon rather light, determined to attempt it by storm&mdash;The
enemy were apprized of it&mdash;however, he passed the first barrier,
and was attempting the second, where he was unfortunately
killed, with several other brave officers&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Washington.</span> Is General Montgomery killed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> He is certainly, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Washington.</span> I am sorry for it&mdash;a brave man&mdash;I could
wish him a better fate!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Lee.</span> I lament the loss of him&mdash;a resolute soldier&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Putnam.</span> Pity such bravery should prove unsuccessful,
such merit unrewarded;&mdash;but the irreversible decree of Providence!&mdash;who
can gainsay?&mdash;we may lament the loss of a
friend, but 'tis irreligious to murmur at pre-ordination. What
happ'ned afterwards?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> The officer next in command, finding their
attacks at that time unsuccessful, retired in good order.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Washington.</span> What became of Colonel Arnold?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Colonel Arnold, at the head of about three hundred
and fifty brave troops, and Captain Lamb's company of
artillery, having in the mean time passed through St. Rocques,
attacked a battery, and carried it, tho' well defended, with the
loss of some men&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Putnam.</span> I hope they proved more successful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Lee.</span> Aye, let us hear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> The Colonel about this time received a wound in
his leg, and was obliged to crawl as well as he cou'd to the hospital,
thro' the fire of the enemy, and within fifty yards of the walls,
but, thro' Providence, escap'd any further damage.&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Putnam.</span> Aye, providential indeed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Washington.</span> Is he dangerously wounded?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> I am told not, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Washington.</span> I am glad of it.&mdash;What follow'd?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> His brave troops pushed on to the second barrier,
and took possession of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Washington.</span> Very good&mdash;proceed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> A party of the enemy then sallying out from the
palace-gate, attacked them in the rear, whom they fought with
incredible bravery for three hours, and deeds of eternal fame
were done; but being surrounded on all sides, and overpowered
by numbers, were at last obliged to submit themselves as prisoners
of war.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Putnam.</span> Heav'ns! could any thing prove more unlucky?
such brave fellows deserve better treatment than they'll get (I'm
afraid) from the inhuman Carleton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Lee.</span> Such is the fortune of war, and the vicissitudes
attending a military life; to-day conquerors, to-morrow prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Washington.</span> He dares not treat them ill&mdash;only as
prisoners. Did you learn how those brave fellows were treated?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> It was currently reported in the camp they
were treated very humanely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Washington.</span> A change for the better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Putnam.</span> Produc'd by fear, no doubt from General
Montgomery's letter&mdash;but no matter from what cause.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Lee.</span> How far did the remainder of the army retire?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> About two miles from the city, where they are
posted very advantageously, continuing the blockade, and waiting
for reinforcements.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Lee.</span> Did the enemy shew any peculiar marks of distinction
to the corpse of General Montgomery?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> He was interred in Quebec, with ev'ry possible
mark of distinction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Washington.</span> What day did the affair happen on?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> On the last day of the year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Washington.</span> A remarkable day! When was the General
interred?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> The second of January.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Lee.</span> What number of men in the whole attack was
killed? did you learn?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> About sixty killed and wounded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Washington.</span> Have you any thing further to communicate?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span> Nothing, sir, but to inform you they are all in
good spirits, and desire reinforcements, and heavy artillery may
be sent them as soon as possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Washington.</span> That be our business&mdash;with all despatch.
You may for the present withdraw. Serjeant!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Serjeant</span>.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Serjeant.</span> I wait your order, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Washington.</span> See that the Messenger and his horse
want for nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Serjeant.</span> I shall, sir.</p>

<p class="center gap2"><span class="smcap">Scene</span> IV.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Washington.</span> I'll despatch an Express to the Congress.
This repulse, if I mistake not (or victory, as Carleton may call
it), will stand 'em but in little stead&mdash;'t will be only a temporary
reprieve&mdash;we'll reinforce our friends, let the consequence be
what it may&mdash;Quebec must fall, and the lofty strong walls and
brazen gates (the shield of cowards) must tumble by an artificial
earthquake; should they continue in their obstinacy, we'll
arm our friends with missive thunders in their hands, and stream
death on them swifter than the winds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Lee.</span> I lament the loss of the valiant Montgomery and
his brave officers and soldiers (at this time more especially) 'tis
the fortune of war, 'tis unavoidable; yet, I doubt not, out of their
ashes will arise new heroes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Putnam.</span> Who can die a more glorious, a more honourable
death than in their country's cause?&mdash;let it redouble our
ardour, and kindle a noble emulation in our breasts&mdash;let each
American be determined to conquer or die in a righteous cause.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Washington.</span> I have drawn my sword, and never will
I sheathe it, till America is free, or I'm no more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Lee.</span> Peace is despaired of, and who can think of submission?
The last petition from the Congress, like the former,
has been disregarded; they prayed but for liberty, peace and
safety, and their omnipotent authoritative supreme-ships will
grant them neither: War, then, war open and understood, must
be resolved on; this, this will humble their pride, will bring their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
tyrant noses to the ground, teach 'em humility, and force them to
hearken to reason when 'tis too late. My noble General, I join
you. [<i>Drawing his sword.</i>] I'll away with the scabbard, and
sheathe my sword in the bosom of tyranny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Putnam.</span> Have you not read the speech, where frowning
revenge and sounds of awful dread for disgrace at Lexington and
loss at Bunker's Hill echo forth? Not smiling peace, or pity,
tame his sullen soul; but, Pharaoh-like, on the wings of tyranny
he rides and forfeits happiness to feast revenge, till the waters
of the red sea of blood deluge the tyrant, with his mixed host of
vile cut-throats, murderers, and bloody butchers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Washington.</span> Yet, finding they cannot conquer us,
gladly would they make it up by a voluntary free-will offering
of a million of money in bribes, rather than be obliged to relish
the thoughts of sacrificing their cursed pride and false honour,
they sending over to amuse us (to put us off our guard) a score
or two of commissioners with sham negotiations in great state,
to endeavour to effect, by bribery, deception and chicanery,
what they cannot accomplish by force. Perish such wretches!&mdash;detested
be their schemes!&mdash;Perish such monsters!&mdash;a reproach
to human understanding&mdash;their vaunted boasts and threats
will vanish like smoke, and be no more than like snow falling
on the moist ground, melt in silence, and waste away&mdash;Blasted,
forever blasted be the hand of the villainous traitor that receives
their gold upon such terms&mdash;may he become leprous, like Naaman,
the Syrian, yea, rather like Gehazi, the servant of Elisha,
that it may stick to him for ever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gen. Putnam.</span> I join you both, and swear by all the heroes
of New-England, that this arm, tho' fourscore and four [<i>Drawing
his sword.</i>], still nervous and strong, shall wield this sword to the
last in the support of liberty and my country, revenge the insult
offer'd to the immortal Montgomery, and brutal treatment of
the brave Allen.</p>
